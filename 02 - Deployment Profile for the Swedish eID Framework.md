## 1. Introduction

This profile specifies behaviour and options that deployments of the SAML
V2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile \[[SAML2Prof](#saml2prof)\]
are required or permitted to rely on. The requirements specified in this profile
are in addition to the underlying normative requirements of \[[SAML2Prof](#saml2prof)\]
(as modified by \[[SAML v2.0 Errata 05](#saml2errata05)\]).

> Note: The profile is influenced by, but not normatively dependent on, [SAML2Int](https://kantarainitiative.github.io/SAMLprofiles/saml2int.html).

Readers should be familiar with all relevant reference documents, and
any requirements stated are not repeated unless where deemed necessary
to clarify or highlight a certain issue.

Any SAML features specified in referenced SAML documents that are
optional are out of scope of this profile, unless explicitly specified
by this profile.

<a name="requirements-notation"></a>
### 1.1. Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
\[[RFC2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)\].

The use of SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and RECOMMENDED reflects broad consensus
on deployment practices intended to foster both interoperability and
guarantees of security and confidentiality needed to satisfy the
requirements of many organizations that engage in the use of federated
identity. Deviating may limit a deployment's ability to technically
interoperate without additional negotiation, and should be undertaken
with caution.

<a name="references-to-saml-2.0-standards-and-profiles"></a>
### 1.2. References to SAML 2.0 Standards and Profiles

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 core specification
\[[7.2.](#saml2core)\], the following syntax is used:

-   `<saml2p:Protocolelement>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0
    Protocol namespace.

-   `<saml2:Assertionelement>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0
    Assertion namespace.

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 metadata specifications,
the following syntax is used:

-   `<md:Metadataelement>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2Meta](#saml2meta)\].

-   `<mdui:Element>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2MetaUI](#saml2metaui)\].

-   `<mdattr:Element>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2MetaAttr](#saml2metaattr)\].

-  `<alg:Element>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2MetaAlgSupport](#saml2metaalg)\].

When referring to elements from the "Identity Provider Discovery Service Protocol and Profile" specification \[[IdpDisco](#idpdisco)\], the following syntax is used:

- `<idpdisc:DiscoveryResponse>`

When referring to elements from the W3C XML Signature namespace
(`http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig\#`) the following syntax is used:

-   `<ds:Signature>`

**Note**: For all references to core SAML specifications, direct or indirect, the \[[SAML v2.0 Errata 05](#saml2errata05)\] MUST always be considered.

<a name="metadata-and-trust-management"></a>
## 2. Metadata and Trust Management

Identity Providers and Service Providers conformant with this profile MUST provide a SAML 2.0 Metadata document representing its entity. The provided metadata MUST conform to "Metadata for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0", \[[SAML2Meta](#saml2meta)\], and SHOULD follow "SAML v2.0 Metadata Profile for Algorithm Support Version 1.0", \[[SAML2MetaAlgSupport](#saml2metaalg)\].

Services conforming to this profile MUST be able to consume SAML metadata on an automated and periodic basis using the processing rules defined by "SAML V2.0 Metadata Interoperability Profile Version 1.0" \[[SAML2MetaIOP](#saml2metaiop)\]. Automatic consumption of metadata MUST be followed by a successful signature verification of the downloaded metadata before it is trusted and used. 

<a name="requirements-for-metadata-content"></a>
### 2.1. Requirements for Metadata Content

<a name="generic"></a>
#### 2.1.1. Generic

<a name="display-information"></a>
##### 2.1.1.1. Display Information

All services that are represented in the Metadata SHALL include a
`<md:Organization>` element with mandatory child elements, which
includes at least one of each of the elements
`<md:OrganizationName>`, `<md:OrganizationDisplayName>` and
`<md:OrganizationURL>`.

The `<md:OrganizationName>` element SHALL hold a registered name of
the organization, which matches the agreement with the federation
operator.

The `<md:OrganizationDisplayName>` element SHALL contain a display
name of the organization and SHALL NOT contain a service name that is
unrelated to the name of the organization.

Metadata for an entity SHALL contain an `<mdui:UIInfo>`
extension, extending the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` or `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element 
(depending on the type of the entity). This `<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL at least contain a
`<mdui:DisplayName>` element with the language attribute `sv`
(Swedish), representing the entity name that has been approved
by the federation operator. The `<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL also
contain a reference to one, or more, logotype images (`<mdui:Logo>`) as described in section 2.1.5
of \[[SAML2MetaUI](#saml2metaui)\] and SHOULD
contain a `<mdui:Description>` element with the language attribute
`sv` (Swedish).

It is RECOMMENDED that the above elements represented in Swedish also be
represented with the language attribute `en` (English).

A federation operator may impose further requirements regarding the `<mdui:UIInfo>` extension.

<a name="certificates-in-metadata"></a>
##### 2.1.1.2. Certificates in Metadata

Public keys used for signature validation and encryption MUST be expressed via X.509
certificates included in metadata as `<ds:X509Certificate>` child elements to
`<md:KeyDescriptor>` elements. These certificates merely acts as containers for the public keys 
needed for signature validation and encryption and the consumer of a metadata entry cannot
expect to be able to execute a successful certificate path validation of such certificates.
A metadata consumer MUST NOT reject a metadata entry due to that certificate trust is missing,
the certificate is expired, or certificate revocation information is missing.

However, for interoperability reasons it is RECOMMENDED that:

* self-signed certificates are used,
* non-expired certificates (with a long validity time) are used,
* certificates are not signed with MD5- och SHA1-based signature algorithms. 

All services represented in metadata SHOULD include at least one `<md:KeyDescriptor>` 
element holding a certificate to be used for signature validation (with the `use`-attribute
set to `signing`), and one `<md:KeyDescriptor>` element containing a certificate 
to be used for message encryption (with the `use`-attribute set to `encryption`).
It is allowed to use the same key and certificate for both usages, but in order to enable
a future key rollover it is RECOMMENDED to avoid using only one `<md:KeyDescriptor>` element
for both usages (i.e., with an absent `use`-attribute).

In order to facilitate key rollover of a signing key, a service MUST support multiple signing 
certificates found in peer metadata and MUST support signature validation using a key from 
any of the available peer signature certificates.

For key rollover of encryption keys, the service that is performing the key rollover MUST only
publish the latest key (in a certificate) to its metadata entry. Until all peers have consumed
the service's metadata entry containing the new certificate, the service MUST support decrypting 
messages using both the old and new key.

<a name="declaring-algorithm-support"></a>
##### 2.1.1.3. Declaring Algorithm Support

Services MAY declare encryption and signature capabilities as defined in \[[SAML2MetaAlgSupport](#saml2metaalg)\]. The declared algorithms MUST meet the algorithm requirements defined by the Swedish eID Framework or by the federation operator . Thus, it is not allowed to declare an algorithm, or key size, that is prohibited from use. 

All services conformant with this specification MUST support the mandatory algorithms defined by the Swedish eID Framework, meaning that a service has no possibility to opt-out from a certain mandatory algorithm by excluding it from the declared capabilities. The main purpose of declaring an algorithm using any of the elements `<md:EncryptionMethod>`, `<alg:SigningMethod>` or `<alg:DigestMethod>` is to declare which algorithm the service prefers.

<a name="service-providers"></a>
#### 2.1.2. Service Providers

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of a Service Provider’s
entity descriptor SHOULD contain one entity category attribute
\[[EntCat](#entcat)\] that holds at least
one attribute value representing a service entity category as defined in
\[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\], identifying the Service Provider requirements in relation to
identity services concerning attribute release and level of assurance.

The example below illustrates how an entity declares the service entity
category identifier **`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr`** in its
metadata.

```
<md:Extensions>
  <mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
    <saml2:Attribute Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category"
                     NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
                     xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
      <saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">
        http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr
      </saml2:AttributeValue>
    </saml2:Attribute>
  </mdattr:EntityAttributes>
</md:Extensions>
```

If a Service Provider does not have any attribute requirements other than those
implicitly requested by inclusion of one or more service entity categories, the
metadata entry of the Service Provider SHOULD NOT include a
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element (with `<md:RequestedAttribute>` 
elements). 

Any needs for particular attributes from Identify Providers, when
present, MUST be expressed through present service entity categories in
combination with `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements under the
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element in the Service
Provider metadata. The `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements in the
Service Provider metadata, when present, hold a list of requested and/or
required attributes. This list of attributes MUST be interpreted in the
context of present service entity categories defined in \[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\].

> Note: Only the requirements for attributes that are not implicitly requested through a declared
service entity category need to be expressed as `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements.

A Service Provider MAY sign authentication request messages sent to
Identity Providers. A Service Provider that signs authentication
requests messages MAY also ensure that a receiving Identity Provider
will only accept valid signed requests from this Service Provider by
assigning the `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the
`<md:SPSSODescriptor>` to a value of `true`.

Section E7, “Metadata for Agreeing to Sign Authentication Requests”, of
\[[SAML v2.0 Errata 05](#saml2errata05)\]
specifies the following concerning the `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute:

> Optional attribute that indicates whether the
> `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages sent by this Service Provider
> will be signed. If omitted, the value is assumed to be false. A value
> of false (or omission of this attribute) does not imply that the
> Service Provider will never sign its requests or that a signed request
> should be considered an error. However, an Identity Provider that
> receives an unsigned `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message from a
> Service Provider whose metadata contains this attribute with a value
> of true MUST return a SAML error response and MUST NOT fulfill the
> request.

Furthermore, a Service Provider MAY require assertions that are issued
to it, to be signed. This is done by assigning the `WantAssertionsSigned`
attribute of the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` to a value of `true`.

Note that the response message that carries the assertion will always be
signed, so the Service Provider should only require signed assertions in
case that it wants to preserve the proof of authenticity of an assertion
separate from the response.

A Service Provider wishing to make use of a central discovery service as specified in the "Identity Provider Discovery Service Protocol Profile" \[[IdPDisco](#idpdisco)\] MUST include at least one `<idpdisc:DiscoveryResponse>` element as an extension under the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element. 

<a name="identity-providers"></a>
#### 2.1.3. Identity Providers

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of an Identity Provider’s
entity descriptor SHOULD contain one entity category attribute
\[[EntCat](#entcat)\] that holds at least
one attribute value representing a service entity category as defined in
\[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\], defining the Identity Provider ability to deliver
assertions (defining the level of assurance and attribute release).

If an Identity Provider has the ability to release attributes, other than those
implicitly given by the declared service entity categories, it is RECOMMENDED that 
those attributes are declared as `<saml:Attribute>` elements under the 
`<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element. 

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of an Identity Provider’s
metadata SHALL contain an attribute according to
\[[SAML2IAP](#saml2iap)\] with its `Name` attribute set to 
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:attribute:assurance-certification`
and holding at least one attribute value identifying a Level of Assurance
(LoA) for which the Identity Provider has been approved and where
the value is one of the identifiers defined in section 3.1.1 of
\[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\] and whose meaning are defined in \[[EidTillit](#eidtillit)\].

```
<md:Extensions>

*Example of how an Identity Provider advertises that the service delivers authentication according to
the `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3` level of assurance.*

An Identity Provider MAY require authentication request messages to be
signed. This is indicated by assigning the
`WantAuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the `<md:IDPSSPDescriptor>`
element to a value of `true`. See further section E7, “Metadata for
Agreeing to Sign Authentication Requests”, of \[[SAML v2.0 Errata
05](#saml2errata05)\].

Identity Providers SHALL advertise support for the SAP protocol according to \[[SigSAP](#sigsap)\], by including the service property entity category URI
`http://id.elegnamnden.se/sprop/1.0/scal2` in its metadata. An Identity Provider that does not advertise support for SAP MAY ignore requests for SAD.

*Example of how an Identity Provider advertises its support for SCAL2 authentication.*

An Identity Provider that wishes to receive the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension in authentication requests SHOULD include the `<psc:RequestedPrincipalSelection>` extension extending the `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element. In this extension the Identity Provider declares which attribute value(s) it wants to receive in authentication requests from requestors using the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` authentication request extension. See [section 5.3.3](#principal-selection) and \[[PrincipalSel](#principalsel)\].

<a name="signature-service"></a>
#### 2.1.4. Signature Service

A Signature Service within the Swedish eID Framework is a Service
Provider with specific requirements concerning its representation in
metadata. 

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of a Signature Service SP
entity descriptor SHALL include the service type entity category
identifier **`http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice`** (\[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\])
as a value to the entity category attribute \[[EntCat](#entcat)\].

```
<mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">`
  <saml2:Attribute Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category"
                   NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
                   xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
    <saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr</saml2:AttributeValue>

  </saml2:Attribute>
</mdattr:EntityAttributes>
```

*Entity attributes for a Signature Service SP.*

A Signature Service MUST assign the `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the
`<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element to `true`. This requirement ensures
that the Signature Service always signs its authentication requests in
order for the request to be accepted by the Identity Provider. The
federation operator will enforce that all Service Providers that operate
as Signature Services have this attribute set.

<a name="name-identifiers"></a>
## 3. Name Identifiers

Identity Providers and Service Providers MUST support both the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` and the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` name identifier
formats as specified in \[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\].

Identity Providers SHALL default to use the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` name identifier
format in cases where a Service Provider has not specified the name
identifier to use (via the `<md:NameIDFormat>` element of the
Service Provider metadata entry, or via the `Format` attribute of the
`<saml2p:NameIDPolicy>` element of the authentication request
message).

<a name="attributes"></a>
## 4. Attributes

Attribute specifications for the Swedish eID Framework are defined in
\[[EidAttributes](#eidattributes)\].

The content of `<saml2:AttributeValue>` elements exchanged via any
SAML 2.0 messages or assertions SHOULD be limited to a single child text
node.

For requirements regarding attribute inclusion in SAML assertions, see
section [6.2.1](#attribute-release-rules), “[Attribute Release Rules](#attribute-release-rules)”, below.

<a name="authentication-requests"></a>
## 5. Authentication Requests

<a name="discovery"></a>
### 5.1. Discovery

This profile does not impose any requirements of
how the process of discovery is implemented by Service Providers wishing
to display user interfaces for selection of Identity Providers for end
users. However, Service Providers making use of a centralized
discovery service as defined in \[[IdpDisco](#idpdisco)\] MUST follow the requirements
stated for discovery responses in 
section [2.1.2](##service-providers), "[Service Providers](#service-providers)".

<a name="binding-and-security-requirements"></a>
### 5.2. Binding and Security Requirements

The endpoints, at which an Identity Provider receives a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, and all subsequent exchanges with
the user agent, MUST be protected by TLS/SSL.

A Service Provider sending an `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message to an Identity Provider
may do so using either the HTTP-Redirect or HTTP-POST binding \[[SAML2Bind](#saml2bind)\]<sup>*</sup>,
meaning that Identity Providers conformant with this profile MUST support the
HTTP-Redirect and the HTTP-POST binding.

An Identity Provider that requires `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages
to be signed MUST not accept messages that are not signed, or where the
verification of the signature fails. In these cases the Identity
Provider MUST respond with an error.

An Identity Provider that itself does not require authentication
messages to be signed MUST still accept and verify signed request
messages from Service Providers that indicate, in their metadata, that
they sign request messages (see [2.1.2](#service-providers) above). If this signature
verification fails, the Identity Provider MUST return a SAML error
response and MUST NOT fulfil the request.

An Identity Provider that receives a request message that is not signed
from a Service Provider that has indicated, in its metadata, that it
will only send signed request messages (see [2.1.2](#service-providers) above) MUST respond
with an error.

The signature for authentication request messages is applied differently
depending on the binding. The HTTP-REDIRECT binding requires the
signature to be applied to the URL-encoded value rather than being
placed within the XML-message (see section 3.4.4.1 of
\[[SAML2Bind](#saml2bind)\]).
For the HTTP-POST binding the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element MUST
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2:AuthnRequest>`.

Before signing the authentication request, the Service Provider SHOULD consult the Identity Provider's metadata (`<alg:SigningMethod>` and `<alg:DigestMethod>` elements) to determine the intersection of algorithms, key sizes and other parameters as defined by particular algorithms that it supports and that the Identity Provider prefers. If the intersection is empty, or if the Identity Provider has not declared any algorithms, the Service Provider MUST use one of the mandatory signing and digest algorithms defined in the Swedish eID Framework during the signature operation.

> \[*\]: A Service Provider should be aware of web browser, or web server, size limitations
of URL:s, and it is RECOMMENDED that a Service Provider use the HTTP-POST binding in cases where 
the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message becomes very large. This may be the case when a `SignMessage`
extension containing much data is used, or when a complete certificate chain is attached to the signature 
of the message.

<a name="message-content"></a>
### 5.3. Message Content

An `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message MUST NOT contain a Document Type Definition (DTD).

The `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message SHOULD contain an
`AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying the desired response
location. The Service Provider MUST NOT use any other values for this
attribute than those listed in its metadata record as
`<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements for the HTTP-POST binding
(see section 4.1.6 of \[[SAML2Prof](#saml2prof)\]), and URL
canonicalization or normalization MUST NOT be required.

A Service Provider MUST NOT include an `AssertionConsumerServiceIndex` attribute.

The `Destination` attribute of the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
MUST contain the URL to which the Service Provider has instructed the
user agent to deliver the request. This is useful to prevent malicious
forwarding of signed requests from being accepted by unintended Identity
Providers.

Identity Providers conformant with this profile MUST support the
`ForceAuthn` and `IsPassive` attributes received in
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages.

Service Providers SHOULD include the `ForceAuthn` attribute in all
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages and explicitly set its value to
`true` or `false`, and not rely on its default value. The reason for this is
to avoid accidental SSO.

If the Service Provider has included more than one `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element in its metadata it is RECOMMENDED that the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message contains the `AttributeConsumingServiceIndex` attribute holding the index of the `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element that the Identity Provider should consider during attribute release.

<a name="requested-authentication-context"></a>
#### 5.3.1. Requested Authentication Context

A Service Provider SHOULD explicitly specify a requested
authentication context element (`<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>`),
containing `<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` elements each holding
a Level of Assurance authentication context URI (see section 3.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\]) 
that the Service Provider considers acceptable for the authentication process.

A present `<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` element MUST specify
exact matching by means of either an absent `Comparison` attribute or a
`Comparison` attribute with the value set to `exact`. This means that the
Identity Provider is forced to return an assertion with exactly one of
the requested `<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` in the request as the
declared `<saml2:AuthnContext>`, or return an error response. If the
Service Provider requires the Identity Provider to return specifically
one out of a selection of acceptable authentication context URIs, then
all of these URIs MUST be included in the request.

The requested authentication context SHOULD be consistent with at least
one of the service entity categories \[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\] declared in the
Service Provider’s metadata entry. See further [section 5.4.4](#authentication-context-and-level-of-assurance-handling) below.

```

requested Level of Assurance is included in an authentication request
message.*

```

*Example of how several Authentication Context URIs are included in an
authentication request message. In this case, the Service Provider
states that it requests the authentication to be performed according to
either the LoA3 URI defined within the Swedish eID Framework or the
substantial level for notified eIDs defined within the eIDAS Framework.*

<a name="scoping"></a>
#### 5.3.2. Scoping

An Identity Provider that acts as a proxy for other Identity Providers SHOULD support the `<saml2p:Scoping>` element holding one, or more, entries signalling to the Proxy Identity Provider which Identity Provider(s) that may be used to authenticate the user. A Service Provider that sends authentication requests to a Proxy
IdP MAY include the `<saml2p:Scoping>` element. See section 3.4.1.5 of \[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\].

```
<saml2p:Scoping>
  <saml2p:IDPList>
    <saml2p:IDPEntry ProviderID="http://idp.example.com" />
  </saml2p:IDPList>
</saml2p:Scoping>
```
*Example of how an `AuthnRequest` contains a `Scoping`-element where the requester (Service Provider) signals to the Proxy IdP which Identity Provider that should perform the authentication of the user.*

The Swedish eIDAS Connector is a Proxy IdP that proxies requests to foreign eIDAS Proxy Services. Normally, the eIDAS connector presents a country selection dialogue to the user, prompting for the country where the user should be directed to for authentication. However, a Service Provider MAY include an eIDAS Proxy Service alias URI for a specific country's Proxy Service under the `<saml2p:Scoping>` element of the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` in order to bypass the country selection dialogue. See section 3.1.9.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\].

```
<saml2p:Scoping>
  <saml2p:IDPList>
    <saml2p:IDPEntry ProviderID="http://id.swedenconnect.se/eidas/1.0/proxy-service/no" />
  </saml2p:IDPList>
</saml2p:Scoping>
```
*Example of how an `AuthnRequest` sent to the eIDAS Connector requests that the eIDAS Connector should
proxy the request to the Norwegian eIDAS Proxy Service for authentication.*

> **Note**: A Service Provider may list more than one country in the `<saml2p:IDPList>` of a `<saml2p:Scoping>` element. The eIDAS Connector will then present a country selection dialogue containing only the listed countries.

**Note:** Another method of bypassing the country selection dialogue is to include the `c` (`urn:oid:2.5.4.6`) 
attribute with the country code for the requested country as its value in a `<psc:PrincipalSelection>`
extension of the `AuthnRequest` message, see section [5.3.3](#principal-selection) below.

<a name="principal-selection"></a>
#### 5.3.3. Principal Selection

The specification "Principal Selection in SAML Authentication Requests", \[[PrincipalSel](#principalsel)\], defines the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension that enables a requestor to inform the Identity Provider about known attributes for the principal that is about to be authenticated. 

This may be relevant for Identity Provider services who prompt users for an identifier in order initiate an authentication process with the user's eID. In such cases, this extension can be used to avoid unnecessary prompting when the user's identity is known in advance to the service requesting authentication, such as when a previously authenticated user is requested to sign a document.

An Identity Provider that wishes to receive the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension SHOULD advertise this in its metadata according to [section 2.1.3](#identity-providers).

A Service Provider that sends an authentication request  to an Identity Provider that has declared that it wishes to receive certain attribute values MAY include the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, provided that the Service Provider has knowledge about this information.

A Service Provider that is a Signature Service SHOULD include the extension for the case described above.

<a name="processing-requirements"></a>
### 5.4. Processing Requirements

<a name="validation-of-destination"></a>
#### 5.4.1. Validation of Destination

An Identity Provider receiving a `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
MUST verify that the `Destination` attribute is present, and that it is
consistent with URLs configured in the Identity Provider’s metadata.

<a name="validation-of-assertion-consumer-addresses"></a>
#### 5.4.2. Validation of Assertion Consumer Addresses

If the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute is present in the
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, its value MUST be verified to be
consistent with one of the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements
having the HTTP-POST binding found in the Service Provider’s metadata
entry. If this is not the case, the request must be rejected.

If the attribute is not present in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>`
message, the Identity Provider MUST obtain the desired response location
from the Service Provider’s metadata entry. This location is found in an
`<md:AssertionConsumerService>` element with HTTP-POST binding that
is marked as default (has the `isDefault` attribute set), or if no element
has the `isDefault` attribute set, the one with the lowest index value
(see section 2.4.4.1 of \[[SAML2Meta](#saml2meta)\]).

<a name="identity-provider-user-interface"></a>
#### 5.4.3. Identity Provider User Interface

An Identity Provider presenting information related to a Service Provider
in its user interface during processing of an `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
MUST obtain this information from the
`<mdui:UIInfo>` element of the Service Provider’s metadata entry.
Implementers of this profile MUST be capable of handling display
information stored in the `<mdui:DisplayName>`, `<mdui:Logo>`
and the `<mdui:Description>` elements.

An Identity Provider displaying logotypes found in a Service Provider's
metadata MUST be able to handle embedded in-line images, as well as
vector-based images where the height and width given in metadata should
be interpreted as image dimensions and not the actual size.

<a name="authentication-context-and-level-of-assurance-handling"></a>
#### 5.4.4. Authentication Context and Level of Assurance Handling

This framework defines a number of authentication context identifiers
(URI), where each such identifier specifies a defined Level of Assertion
and may define specific requirements on the authentication process.
There can be multiple authentication context URIs representing the same
Level of Assertion, but one authentication context URI always identifies
one defined Level of Assurance. 

Identity Providers SHALL exclusively use one of the requested
authentication contexts in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` in the
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element under the
`<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` element, when present, to determine
the requested authentication process and Level of Assurance. The
Identity Provider SHALL respond with an error `<saml2p:StatusCode>`
with the value `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester`
\[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\]
if no requested authentication context is supported. If no requested
authentication context is present in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>`,
the Identity Provider MAY return the result of a default authentication
process that is consistent with the Identity Providers metadata.

**Note**: The Identity Provider does not have to consider the service
entity categories (\[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\]) declared in the Service Provider’s
metadata entry when determining the requested authentication context
under which the authentication should be performed. The purpose of the
service entity categories is primarily to support service matching in
discovery services and attribute release policies in Identity Providers.
Significant Identity Provider products and software are not equipped to
use service entity category information to determine the requested
authentication context.

<a name="single-sign-on-processing"></a>
#### 5.4.5. Single Sign On Processing

An Identity Provider conformant to this profile MAY issue an assertion
relying on a previously established security context (active session)
instead of authenticating the user. However, the Identity Provider MUST
NOT re-use an already existing security context in the following cases:

-   When the security context has expired, i.e., the time elapsed since
    the security context was established is too long given the
    SSO-policy stipulated by the federation or Identity Provider itself.

-   When the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` contains a `ForceAuthn` attribute
    with the value of `true`.

-   If the original authentication process, which led to the
    establishment of the security context, was performed using another
    Level of Assurance that what is requested in the current
    `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message.

If the Identity Provider user interface contains some sort of user
consent, or information, concerning which attributes, or any other
information, that is included in an assertion being issued, the Identity
Provider SHOULD preserve this functionality if a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message requesting a different set of
attributes (or any other information) compared to what was delivered in
the assertion at the time of establishing the security context. The
Identity Provider may require re-authentication or display a user
interface for consent/information in these cases.

<a name="authentication-responses"></a>
## 6. Authentication Responses

<a name="security-requirements"></a>
### 6.1. Security Requirements

The endpoint(s) at which a Service Provider receives a
`<saml2p:Response>` message MUST be protected by TLS/SSL.

The `<saml2p:Response>` message issued by the Identity Provider MUST
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2p:Response>` element.

The `<saml2:Assertion>` element issued by the Identity Provider MAY
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2:Assertion>`. If a Service Provider requires signed
assertions, by assigning the `WantAssertionsSigned` attribute of its
metadata record (see [chapter 2.1.2](#service-providers)), the Identity Provider MUST sign
assertions issued to this Service Provider (as well as the response
message as stated above).

Identity Providers SHALL utilize XML Encryption and return a
`<saml2:EncryptedAssertion>` element in the `<saml2p:Response>`
message. The elements `<saml2:EncryptedID>` and
`<saml2:EncryptedAttribute>` MUST NOT be used; instead the entire
assertion MUST be encrypted.

Before performing encryption and signing, the Identity Provider SHOULD consult the Service Provider's metadata (`<md:EncryptionMethod>`, `<alg:SigningMethod>` and `<alg:DigestMethod>` elements) to determine the intersection of algorithms, key sizes and other parameters as defined by particular algorithms that it supports and that the Service Provider prefers. If the intersection is empty, or if the Service Provider has not declared any algorithms, the Identity Provider MUST use algorithms listed as mandatory by the Swedish eID Framework. For encryption, the chosen algorithm MUST also be compatible with the Service Provider's encryption key 
declared in metadata.

Service Providers SHOULD NOT accept unsolicited `<saml2p:Response>`
messages (i.e., responses that are not the result of an earlier
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message). Service Providers that do accept
unsolicited response messages MUST ensure, by other means, that the
security and processing requirements of this profile ([section 6.3](#processing-requirements)) can
be fully satisfied.

<a name="message-content2"></a>
### 6.2. Message Content

The `<saml2:Response>` message MUST NOT contain a Document Type Definition (DTD).

Successful response messages MUST contain exactly one `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element
and exactly one `<saml2:AttributeStatement>` element.

The `<saml2:Response>` message MUST contain an `<saml2:Issuer>`
element containing the unique identifier (entityID) of the issuing
Identity Provider.

The `AuthnInstant` attribute of the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element
MUST be assigned the time when the actual authentication took place.
This time may differ from the `IssueInstant` attribute of the assertion
itself, which holds the time when the assertion was issued. This is
especially important in cases of re-use of already established security
contexts at the Identity Provider side (Single Sign On).

Each identity assertion MUST have a `<saml:Subject>` element that
specifies the principal that is the subject of all of the statements in
the assertion.

The value of the `<saml:NameID>` element under the
`<saml:Subject>` element MUST hold a pseudonym identifier of the
subject, which SHALL be:

-   Unique for the IdP – SP combination being the issuer and recipient
    for the assertion.

-   Constructed in a manner that does not reveal the registered identity
    of the subject.

The `<saml2:Subject>` element MUST contain one
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmation>` element containing a `Method` of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer`. This element MUST contain a
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element that contains at least the
following:

-   An `InResponseTo` attribute matching the request’s ID.

-   A `Recipient` attribute containing the Service Provider’s assertion
    consumer service URL (see sections [5.3](#message-content) and [5.4.1](#validation-of-destination)).

-   A `NotOnOrAfter` attribute containing a time instant at which the
    subject no longer can be confirmed.

The `<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` MUST also contain an `Address`
attribute containing the network address from which an attesting entity
(user) can present the assertion.

The assertion MUST contain a `<saml2:Conditions>` element containing
the following attributes and elements:

-   A `<saml2:AudienceRestriction>` element including the requesting
    Service Provider’s unique identifier (entityID) as an
    `<saml2:Audience>` value.

-   A `NotBefore` attribute specifying the earliest time instant at which
    the assertion is valid.

-   A `NotOnOrAfter` attribute specifying the time instant when the
    assertion expires.

An Identity Provider conformant to this profile MUST, in its issued
assertions, include an authentication context URI indicating under which
Level of Assurance the assertion was issued. This identifier MUST be
placed under the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element as the value of an
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element that is part of the
`<saml2:AuthnContext>` element.

```
<saml2:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant="2013-03-15T09:22:00" SessionIndex="b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac">
  <saml2:AuthnContext>
    <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
    ...
  </saml2:AuthnContext>
</saml2:AuthnStatement>
```

*Example of how an Authentication Context URI identifier representing a
Level of Assurance is included in an authentication statement.*

An Identity Provider that acts as a proxy for other Identity Providers SHOULD include the `<saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>` element under the `<saml2:AuthnContext>` element. This element will contain the entityID of the Identity Provider that authenticated the principal.

```
<saml2:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant="2013-03-15T09:22:00" SessionIndex="b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac">
  <saml2:AuthnContext>
    ...
    <saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>http://idp.example.com/auth</saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>
  </saml2:AuthnContext>
</saml2:AuthnStatement>
```
*Example of how the entityID of an Identity Provider that provided the authentication for the principal is included in an authentication statement.*

<a name="attribute-release-rules"></a>
#### 6.2.1. Attribute Release Rules

An Identity Provider determines which attributes to include in the
`<saml2:AttributeStatement>` element of an assertion based on the
Service Provider requirements and its agreements with the user being
authenticated. Service Provider attribute preferences and requirements
are specified by the service entity categories \[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\] and
requested attributes in the `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element
declared in the Service Provider metadata. A service entity category
specifies the attribute set (as defined in \[[EidAttributes](#eidattributes)\]) that is
requested for the attribute release process.

An Identity Provider declares service entity categories in order to
publish its ability to deliver attributes according to certain attribute
sets. For all declared service entity categories, the Identity Provider
MUST possess the ability to deliver the mandatory attributes of the
underlying attribute set. See \[[EidEntCat](#eidentcat)\] and \[[EidAttributes](#eidattributes)\] for
details.

The Service Provider is responsible for checking that an Identity
Provider is capable of providing necessary attributes before sending a
request and to verify that it received all attributes necessary for
providing a requested service. Checks whether an Identity Provider is
capable of fulfilling the needs of a Service Provider can be done either
by relying on a discovery process to filter out non-conformant Identity
Providers, and/or by examining the metadata of Identity providers. 

An Identity Provider receiving a request for more attributes than it can
provide SHOULD return an assertion with the attributes it can provide
according to its defined attribute release policy if the user has been successfully 
authenticated, leaving it up to the Service Provider to decide how to proceed, 
e.g., by denying service to the authenticated user, provide limited services or to use other
resources to collect necessary attributes. However, if a Service Provider
has expressed a specific attribute requirement using the `<md:RequestedAttribute>`
element of a matching `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element in its metadata
and assigned the `isRequired`-attribute to `true`, and the Identity Provider knows that it will not be able to provide this attribute, then the Identity Provider SHOULD reject any request for authentication from that Service Provider and respond with an error.

For privacy reasons, an Identity Provider SHOULD NOT release identity attributes<sup>*</sup> that are not requested by the Service Provider via its metadata declarations
 (service entity categories or `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements).

> [\*\]: This requirement does not apply to attributes that are not "identity" attributes, for example transaction identifiers or any other attribute that does not directly belong to a user's identity.

<a name="processing-requirements2"></a>
### 6.3. Processing Requirements

This profile mandates a correct processing of a `<saml2p:Response>`
message in order to ensure proper protection from the security threats
described in \[[SAML2Sec](#saml2sec)\].
Processing requirements are listed in \[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\],
\[[SAML2Prof](#saml2prof)\] and \[[SAML2Sec](#saml2sec)\].
This document will list the necessary requirements that apply to this
profile.

After the Service Provider has encrypted the assertion from the received
response message the following requirements apply. Any verification that
fails MUST lead to that the Service Provider rejects the response
message and does not use the assertion.

Some of the processing requirements below are defined in order to
protect from MITM- or MITB-attacks<sup>*</sup> were unsigned authentication
requests may be changed before being sent to the Identity Provider.
However, a Service Provider MUST implement all of the specified
processing requirements even if it sends signed authentication request
messages.

> \[*\]: MITM stands for ”man in the middle” and MITB stands for ”man in the browser”.

<a name="signature-validation"></a>
#### 6.3.1. Signature Validation

The signature present on the `<saml2p:Response>` message, and
optionally on the `<saml2:Assertion>`, MUST be successfully
verified.

The public key being used to verify the signature MUST appear in the
issuing Identity Provider’s metadata record (as a
`<ds:X509Certificate>` under the `<ds:KeyInfo>` element).

<a name="subject-confirmation"></a>
#### 6.3.2. Subject Confirmation

Based on the `InResponseTo` attribute of the
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` the Service Provider MUST be able
to obtain the corresponding `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, or a
secure context containing corresponding information from the request
(for future processing of the assertion).

The `Recipient` attribute from the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element MUST match the location to
which the `<saml2p:Response>` message was delivered **and** match
the value the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute included in the
request message, or if this attribute was not provided in the request
message, the default response location specified in the Service
Provider’s metadata entry, as described in [section 5.4.2](#validation-of-assertion-consumer-addresses).

The time from the `NotOnOrAfter` attribute from the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` MUST NOT have passed compared with
the time instant at which the subject is confirmed (i.e., when the
assertion is validated). A reasonable allowable clock skew between the
providers should be taken in account.

If the `Address` attribute is assigned to the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element, the Service Provider MAY
choose to check the user agent’s client address against it. Practical
issues regarding the Service Provider’s network setup and the risk of
introducing false negatives makes this an optional step in the
validation phase.

<a name="conditions"></a>
#### 6.3.3. Conditions

The Service Provider MUST assert that the value of the
`<saml2:Audience>` element under the
`<saml2:AudienceRestriction>` element matches the unique entityID of
the Service Provider.

The Service Provider MUST verify that the time instant at which the
assertion is validated is within the range given by the `NotBefore` and
`NotOnOrAfter` attributes of the `<saml2:Conditions>` element
(allowing for a reasonable clock skew). See also the processing of the
`NotOnOrAfter` attribute in [section 6.3.2](#subject-confirmation).

<a name="the-authentication-statement"></a>
#### 6.3.4. The Authentication Statement

The Service Provider MUST assert that the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>`
contains a `<saml2:AuthnContext>` element that holds a
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element having as its value the
authentication context URI indicating under which Level of Assurance the
authentication was performed. If the Service Provider declared one, or more, 
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` elements under the `<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>`
element of the authentication request (see [section 5.4](#message-content)), 
the received authentication context URI MUST match one of the declared 
authentication context URI:s from the request. If not, the Service Provider 
MUST reject the assertion<sup>*</sup>.

> \[*\]: If the Service Provider does not declare an authentication context URI
> in the authentication request it should be prepared to receive any of the
> authentication context URI:s declared by the Identity Provider in its metadata
> record (see [section 2.1.3](#identity-providers)).

<a name="general-security-validation"></a>
#### 6.3.5. General Security Validation

In order to protect itself from replay attacks, the Service Provider
MUST ensure that the same assertion is not processed more than once
within the time it is valid (with respect to the `NotOnOrAfter` attribute
of the `<saml2:Conditions>` element).

In order to prevent stolen assertions and user impersonation, the
Service Provider SHOULD implement a validation that rejects an assertion
if the time given it its `IssueInstant` attribute compared to the time
when the response message is received is too great. This time is
typically on the order of seconds, and limits the time window when a
stolen assertion could be used.

If the Service Provider included the attribute `ForceAuthn` with a value
of `true` in the authentication request, the Service Provider SHOULD
ensure that the `AuthnInstant` attribute of the
`<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element is greater than the time when the
request was sent (allowing for a reasonable clock skew).

A reasonable clock skew according to this profile is between 3 and 5 minutes in either direction.

<a name="error-responses"></a>
### 6.4. Error Responses

If the Identity Provider returns an error, it MUST NOT include any
assertions in the `<saml2p:Response>` message.

An Identity Provider conformant with this profile SHOULD NOT make use of
any other `<saml2p:StatusCode>` values than those specified in
section 3.2.2.2 of
\[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\] or in section 3.1.4 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\]. 
The top-level `<saml2p:StatusCode>` value may only be one of the following error
identifiers:

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester` – The request could not
    be performed due to an error on the part of the Service Provider.

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder` – The request could not
    be performed due to an error on the part of the Identity Provider.

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:VersionMismatch` – The Identity
    Provider could not process the request because the version of the
    request message was incorrect.

If the user cancels an authentication process the Identity Provider
SHOULD indicate this by assigning the second-level status code to
`http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/cancel`.

If an Identity Provider displays information describing an error in its
user interface it MUST also offer ways for the end user to confirm this
information (for example, by including an OK-button). When the end user
acknowledges taking part of the information (i.e., clicks on the OK-button),
the `<saml2p:Response>` message is posted back to the Service
Provider according to the HTTP POST binding \[[SAML2Bind](#saml2bind)\].

If an Identity Provider detects suspicious fraudulent behaviour or if any of its security checks alerts a (possible) fraud, the Identity Provider MUST NOT issue an assertion but instead display an error message. After the end user confirms this error message, the error message posted back to the Service Provider SHOULD contain a second-level status code set to `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/fraud` or `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/possibleFraud` (depending on whether the Identity Provider aborted the authentication due to a determined or suspected fraud).

<a name="authentication-for-signature"></a>
## 7. Authentication for Signature

“DSS Extension for Federated Central Signing Services”, \[[EidDSS](#eiddss)\],
defines an extension to the OASIS DSS protocol for providing centralized
Signature Services within the Swedish eID Framework. This specification
defines the communication between a *Signature Requestor*<sup>*</sup> and a
Signature Service, but does not cover SAML specific requirements
regarding the user authentication phase that is part of the signature
process.

This section defines requirements on the SAML authentication process
when authentication is requested by a Signature Service, acting as a
SAML Service Provider. All requirements regarding user authentication
specified earlier in this profile are still valid. This section extends
these requirements for the “authentication for signature” process.

> \[*\]: A Signature Requestor is a Service Provider within the federation to which the user previously has logged in to and from where the user initiates a signature operation.

<a name="authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services"></a>
### 7.1. Authentication Context URIs for Signature Services (deprecated)

Earlier versions of the Swedish eID Framework defined a set of Authentication Context URI:s with the following meaning:

- for Signature Services, a means to require that a sign message would be displayed by the Identity Provider processing the authentication request, and,

- for Identity Providers, to include in issued assertions as an evidence that the sign message was displayed for the user.

Implementations using the special purpose Authentication Context URI:s for sign message turned out to be complex as the number of authentication context classes expands to align with eIDAS and other federations. Usage of these special purpose Authentication Context URI:s has therefore been deprecated and replaced with a more straightforward method of requesting and asserting the displaying of sign messages, see sections [7.2.1](#requesting-display-of-signature-message) and [7.3](#authentication-responses2) below.

However, for backwards compatibility reasons, up until the 31th of December 2020, Identity Providers MUST support processing of the special purpose sigmessage URI:s according to version 1.5 of "Deployment Profile for the Swedish eID Framework", \[[EidDeploy_1.5](#eiddeploy_15)\]. 

<b>Deprecated requirements:</b>

> The Swedish eID Framework defines additional authentication context URIs
to be used in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` and `<saml2:Assertion>`
elements during “authentication for signature”. These authentication
context URIs are applicable when the Identity Provider is required to
display a sign message as part of the authentication process. They
are refered to as "Sign Message Authentication Context URIs" and
are defined in section 3.1.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\].

> A sign message authentication context URI extends the corresponding authentication context URI used to represent a Level of Assurance identifier (as defined in section 3.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\]) with requirements listed in the sections below.

> For example, the `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3-sigmessage` URI is the sign message authentication context URI corresponding to the `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3` Level of Assurance identifier.

> A Signature Service MAY use any of the defined authentication context
URIs. The URIs listed in section 3.1.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\] are only used when 
there is an explicit requirement for the Identity Provider to display a sign message provided
in the authentication request.


<a name="authentication-requests2"></a>
### 7.2. Authentication Requests

Authentication requests from a Signature Service SHALL meet the
following requirements:

-   The `ForceAuthn` attribute of the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element
    MUST be set to `true`.

-   The `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element MUST be signed. This MUST
    also be indicated in the Signature Service metadata record using the
    `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute (see [section 2.1.4](#signature-service)).

If the receiving Identity Provider has declared that it wishes to receive principal selection information about the signer (see [section 5.3.3](#principal-selection)), and the Signature Service has received any of the requested attribute values in the `Signer` element of the `SignRequest` (\[[EidDSS](#eiddss)\]), the Signature Service SHOULD include those attribute values in a `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension of the authentication request. 

It is RECOMMENDED that the `<saml2p:Scoping>` element containing a `<saml2p:RequesterID>` element holding the entityID of the Service Requestor is included in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages generated by a Signature Service.

    <saml2p:Scoping>
      <saml2p:RequesterID>http://www.origsp.com/sp</saml2:RequesterID>
    </saml2p:Scoping>

*Example when the `<saml2p:RequesterID>` element is used to inform the Identity Provider about which Service Provider that requested the signature associated with this request for authentication.*

> The reason for this recommendation is that an Identity Provider may adapt user interfaces or authentication procedures to different Service Providers based on either static configuration or on information found in the Service Provider's metadata. It can therefore be useful for an Identity Provider to know which Service Provider that requested the signature (*Signature Requestor*) that caused a Signature Service to request authentication. The Identity Provider may use this information to maintain the same user experience and procedures regardless of whether authentication is requested directly by the Service Provider, or by a Signature Service as a result of a signature request from the same Service Provider.

An Identity Provider that accepts an `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
from a Service Provider that has indicated that it is a Signature
Service<sup>*</sup> MUST provide a user interface that is indicating that the
end user is performing a signature.

> \[*\]: An Identity Provider identifies a Service Provider as a Signature Service if it declares the `http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice` URI as a service type entity category in its metadata (see [2.1.4](#signature-service)).

<a name="requesting-display-of-signature-message"></a>
#### 7.2.1. Requesting Display of Signature Message

\[[EidDSS\_Profile](#eiddssprofile)\] specifies that a Signature Requestor may include a
`SignMessage` element (as defined by \[[EidDSS](#eiddss)\]) in a signature request.
This element holds a message that the Identity Provider, which is
responsible for “authentication for signature”, should present to the
user that is performing the signature.

A Signature Service MAY request the Identity Provider to show a sign
message to the user by including the `SignMessage` element from the
signature request as a child element to an `<saml2p:Extensions>`
element in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message (see section 3.2.1 of
\[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\]).

All Identity Providers compliant with this profile MUST be able to parse and understand
the `SignMessage` extension.

If the `Message`-element of the `SignMessage` is to be encrypted, the Service Provider SHOULD consult the Identity Provider's metadata (`<md:EncryptionMethod>` elements) to determine the intersection of algorithms, key sizes and other parameters as defined by particular algorithms that it supports and that the Identity Provider prefers. If the intersection is empty, or if the Identity Provider has not declared any algorithms, the Service Provider MUST use one of the mandatory algorithms defined in the Swedish eID Framework during the encryption operation, which is compatible with the Identity Provider's encryption key declared in metadata.

If an Identity Provider that has ways of determining the principal's identity before displaying
a sign message receives a `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension in  the authentication request 
it SHOULD ensure that the contents of the `<psc:PrincipalSelection>` extension matches the 
principal identity. If there is a mismatch, the Identity Provider MUST NOT display the
sign message, and if the request states that the sign message must be displayed, fail with
an error response where the second-level status code is set to
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:UnknownPrincipal` \[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\].

> Typical scenarios where the above requirement apply is for the Swedish eIDAS connector that first authenticates a principal and then displays the sign message, and for Identity Providers that prompt the user for its user identity as part of its authentication scheme. In those scenarios the Identity Providers must compare the principal identity with the contents of `<psc:PrincipalSelection>`, if received in the authentication request. 

Identity Providers processing a request containing a `SignMessage` extension SHALL meet
the following requirements (in addition to other general requirements associated with requests 
from signature services):

- If the `MustShow` attribute of the `SignMessage` extension is set, the Identity Provider
  MUST fail with an error response if the message, for some reason, can not be displayed 
  to the user.
  
- The Identity Provider MUST display the sign message to the user in a manner that is consistent 
  with the data format of the sign message. If necessary, the Identity Provider MUST process 
  defined filtering rules on the message. If the present message format is not supported or the 
  sign message for any reason cannot be displayed in a proper manner, the Identity Provider must
  return an error response.
  
- If authentication and sign message confirmation by the user was successful, the Identity Provider 
  MUST include the `signMessageDigest` attribute (see section 3.2.4 of \[[EidAttributes](#eidattributes)\]) 
  in the assertion that is issued.

- The Identity Provider MUST NOT return an assertion without performing an authentication process 
  consistent with the requested authentication context which includes display of a sign message,
  even if the request has no present `ForceAuthn` attribute or includes a `ForceAuthn` attribute set 
  to the value `false`.  

> **Note:** For backwards compatibility reasons, up until the 31th of December 2020, Identity Providers MUST also
apply the above requirements when processing a request with a requested authentication context that is a 
"Sign Message Authentication Context URI" along with the following (deprecated) requirement:

> -   The authentication request SHALL contain a sign message that can be
    extracted by the Identity Provider. If the Identity Provider fails
    to locate, decrypt or extract the sign message in clear text form,
    it must return an error response.

    
<a name="requesting-scal2-signature-activation-data"></a>
#### 7.2.2. Requesting SCAL2 Signature Activation Data

The type of signature requested in a signature request is, according to \[[EidDSS_Profile](#eiddssprofile)\], specified by the `CertType` attribute of the `<CertRequestProperties>` element. When the value of this attribute is set to `QC/SSCD`, the requested signature is a Qualified Signature created in a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD). To achieve this level of signature the Authentication Request MUST include a request for Signature Activation Data (SAD) for Sole Control Assurance Level 2 (SCAL2) in accordance with the "Signature Activation Protocol for Federated Signing" \[[SigSAP](#sigsap)\]. An authentication request message that includes this `SADRequest` extension MUST also include the `SignMessage` extension (as described above).

As pointed out in [section 2.1.3](#identity-providers) an Identity Provider that supports processing of SAD requests and issuance of SAD-attributes SHALL advertise this by declaring the service property entity category `http://id.elegnamnden.se/sprop/1.0/scal2` in its metadata. An Identity Provider that has declared this entity category MUST return a SAD attribute in an issued assertion if the corresponding `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message contains the `<sap:SADRequest>` extension.

A SAD returned from the Identity Provider MUST have a signature which can be verified using a certificate from the Identity Provider's metadata entry. The signature algorithm used to sign the SAD MUST be equivalent to the algorithm used to sign the responses and assertions from the Identity Provider.

Verification of a received SAD-attribute MUST follow the verification rules specified in section 3.2.3 of \[[SigSAP](#sigsap)\].

<a name="authentication-responses2"></a>
### 7.3. Authentication Responses

By including the `signMessageDigest` attribute (see section 3.2.4 of \[[EidAttributes](#eidattributes)\]) 
in the SAML assertion, the Identity Provider asserts that it has successfully displayed the sign message
received in the request for the user and that the user has accepted to sign under the context of this sign message. This attribute MUST be included in the issued assertion if a sign message was displayed for, and
accepted by, the user.

Up until the 31th of December 2020, Identity Providers MUST also support the deprecated requirements stated below.

**Deprecated requirements:**

> By including a sign message authentication context URI, as described in [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services), in the SAML assertion under the
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element of the
`<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element in the response, the Identity
Provider asserts that it has successfully displayed the sign message
received in the request for the user and that the user has accepted to
sign under the context of this sign message<sup>*</sup>.

> An Identity Provider MUST NOT return an authentication context URI in an
assertion, other than those defined in section 3.1.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\], 
if the request included one of these URIs as the requested authentication context. If
the Identity Provider failed to display the sign message or the user
failed to accept it, and the request indicated that the sign message
MUST be displayed, then the Identity Provider MUST return an error
response with the status code `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:AuthnFailed`.

> \[*\]: As defined in [section 5.3.1](#requested-authentication-context), only exact matching of authentication context URIs are allowed. As a consequence the Identity Provider can only assert a sign message authentication context URI according to [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services) if such an authentication context was requested in the authentication request. It is therefore the responsibility of the Signature Service requesting authentication to always request a sign message authentication context if it requires evidence that the sign message has been displayed to the user.

<a name="cryptographic-algorithms"></a>
## 8. Cryptographic Algorithms

This section lists the requirements for crypto algorithm support for being compliant with this profile.

For signature and encryption keys the following requirements apply:
* RSA public keys MUST be at least 2048 bits in length. 3072 bits or more is RECOMMENDED.
* EC public keys MUST be at least 256 bits in length (signature only).
  * The curves NIST Curve P-256, NIST Curve P-384 and NIST Curve P-521 MUST be supported (\[[RFC5480](#rfc5480)\]).

Services conforming to this profile MUST support the mandatory algorithms below, and SHOULD support the algorithms listed as optional.

The sender of a secure message MUST NOT use an algorithm that is not listed as mandatory in the sections below, unless it is explicitly declared by the peer in its metadata (see \[[SAML2MetaAlgSupport](#saml2metaalg)\]). 

A service processing a message in which an algorithm not listed below has been used MUST refuse to accept the message and respond with an error, unless this algorithm has been declared as preferred or supported by the service in its metadata entry.

> This profile does not specify a complete list of blacklisted algorithms. However, there is a need to explicitly point out that the commonly used algorithms SHA-1 for digests and RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 for key transport are considered broken and SHOULD not be used or accepted.

The algorithms below are defined in \[[XMLEnc](#xmlenc)\], \[[XMLDSig](#xmldsig)\] and \[[RFC4051](#rfc4051)\].

<a name="digest-algorithms"></a>
### 8.1. Digest Algorithms

**Mandatory:**

* SHA-256, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256`

**Optional:**

* SHA-384, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#sha384`
* SHA-512, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512`

<a name="signature-algorithms"></a>
### 8.2. Signature Algorithms

**Mandatory:**

* RSA-SHA256, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256`
* ECDSA-SHA256, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#ecdsa-sha256`

**Optional:**

* RSA-SHA384, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha384`
* RSA-SHA512, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512`
* ECDSA-SHA384, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#ecdsa-sha384`
* ECDSA-SHA512, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#ecdsa-sha512`

<a name="block-encryption-algorithms"></a>
### 8.3. Block Encryption Algorithms

**Mandatory:**

* AES128-CBC, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc`
* AES192-CBC, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes192-cbc`
* AES256-CBC, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc`

**Optional:**

* AES128-GCM, `http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#aes128-gcm`
* AES192-GCM, `http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#aes192-gcm`
* AES256-GCM, `http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#aes256-gcm`

**Note:** The AES-CBC algorithm has been reported to have vulnerabilities, but these weaknesses can not be exploited when using signed SAML messages. Also, the support for AES-GCM in SAML software is not sufficiently spread at the time of writing. Therefore, the current version of this profile specifies AES-CBC as the default block encryption algorithm.

Services supporting the AES-GCM algorithm SHOULD indicate this in its metadata.

```

</md:KeyDescriptor>
``` 
*Example of how a service announces that it has support for AES-GCM and wishes peers to use these algorithms when encrypting for the service.*

<a name="key-transport-algorithms"></a>
### 8.4. Key Transport Algorithms

**Mandatory:**

* RSA-OAEP-MGF1P, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p`
  * Key transport digest: SHA-1 (`http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1`)

For interoperability reasons the current version of this profile specifies the RSA-OAEP-MGF1P algorithm as the default key transport algorithms. This algorithm's padding method defaults to the use of SHA-1 as a digest algorithm and also uses the "MGF1 with SHA-1" mask generation function<sup>*</sup>.

**Optional:**

* RSA-OAEP-MGF1P, `http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p`
  * Key transport digest: Any of the digest methods listed as mandatory or optional in section [8.1](#digest-algorithms).

A service wishing to receive encrypted messages where SHA-1 is not used as the key transport digest SHOULD indicate this in its metadata using the `<md:EncryptionMethod>` element as the example below.

```
...
<md:EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p">
  <ds:DigestMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256"/>
</md:EncryptionMethod>
...
```
*Example of how a service announces that it wishes that the peer uses SHA-256 as the key transport digest when encrypting using RSA-OAEP-MGF1P.*

> \[*\]: Note that the use if SHA-1 in this context (both as digest algoritm and as mask generation function) is limited to providing randomness of padding data and as a hash over optional OAEP parameter data which typically is an empty string. It is not used as a hash function to assert the integrity of the encrypted data. No weaknesses of SHA-1 is is known to be relevant to its use in this context.

## 10. Changes between versions

**Changes between version 1.6 and 1.7:**

- Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 were updated with clarifications for how a Service Provider declares requested attributes and how an Identity Provider declares its ability to deliver attributes.

- Section 6.2.1, "Attribute Release Rules", was updated with a privacy requirement that tells that an Identity Provider must not release identity attributes not requested by the Service Provider.

**Changes between version 1.5 and 1.6:**

- In order to facilitate algorithm interoperability between peers additions concerning "Metadata Profile for Algorithm Support" \[[SAML2MetaAlgSupport](#saml2metaalg)\] was added. Section 2.1.1 was updated with a section defining how preferred algorithms are declared in metadata, and sections 5.2, 6.1 and 7.2.1 was updated with requirements for algorithm selection during signing and encryption.
- Section 5.3, "Message Content", was re-structured with sub-chapters for requested authentication contexts, scoping and principal selection.
- The `PrincipalSelection` and `RequestedPrincipalSelection` extensions were introduced to sections 2.1.3, 5.3.3 and 7.2.
- The link for the "Tillitsramverk för Svensk e-legitimation" specification was updated.
- This profile is no longer normatively dependent upon SAML2Int. Therefore, the profile has been updated with requirements that previously was implicit (due to the normative dependency to SAML2Int).
- Section 8, "Cryptographic Algorithms", was introduced in order to clearly define the algorithm requirements for services that are conformant to this profile.
- Section 2.1.1 was updated with elaborations concerning certificates in metadata.
- Section 7.2.1 was updated with a requirement that ensures that a sign message is only displayed to the intended user.

- Section 7, "Authentication for Signature", was updated where "Sign Message Authentication Context URI" were deprecated
and the use of the `signMessageDigest` attribute was introduced.

**Changes between version 1.4 and 1.5:**

- Section 2.1.3 "Identity Providers", was extended to include requirements on metadata to signal support for the SAP (Signature Activation Protocol).
- Section 7.2, "Authentication Requests", was extended to recommend the usage of the `<saml2p:RequesterID>` element within `<saml2p:Scoping>`. The reason for this recommendation is that Identity Providers may need information about the "Signature Requestor", i.e., the Service Provider that requested the signature that caused a Signature Service to request authentication.
- Section 6.3.4, "The Authentication Statement", contained a requirement about how to process a received authentication context URI that was incorrect. This has been corrected.
- A new section, 7.2.2, "Requesting SCAL2 Signature Activation Data", was added. This amendment describes how and when to request Signature Activation Data from an Identity Provider in order to enable a signature service to operate as a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD).
- Attribute release rules have been clarified in sections 2.1.2, "Service Providers" and 6.2.1, "Attribute Release Rules".
- Section 2.1.2, "Service Providers", was updated to include a requirement for Service Providers communicating with a centralized discovery service.
- Section 5.3, "Message Content", was updated to describe the use of `<saml2p:IDPEntry>` elements under the `<samp2p:Scoping>` elements for requests sent to Identity Providers acting as proxies for other Identity Providers.
- The reference to \[[SAML2MetaUI](#saml2metaui)\] was updated to the latest official version: http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-metadata-ui/v1.0/sstc-saml-metadata-ui-v1.0.html.
- The reference to \[[EntCat](#entcat)\] was updated to the latest version. 

**Changes between version 1.3 and version 1.4:**

-   Version 1.3 of this profile stated that a
    `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message MUST contain an
    `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying the desired
    response location. It has shown that this requirement aggravates
    interoperability since some of the major providers of Service
    Provider software do not fully support this attribute. Furthermore,
    the requirement does increase security since an Identity Provider
    may only post response messages to locations registered in the
    `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements of the Service Provider
    metadata entry. Therefore, chapter 5.3, “Message Content”, has been
    changed to state that the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message SHOULD
    contain an `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute. Changes have also
    been made to sections 5.4.2 and 6.3.2 where processing requirements
    were updated.

-   In section 5.3, a clarification regarding specifying more than one
    authentication context URI was made.

-   In section 7.1, a set of authentication context URIs for the eIDAS
    Framework was added.

-   In section 6.4, the requirement to use the sub-level status code
    `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/cancel` was added. This status
    should be used to indicate a cancelled operation.

- In section 6.4, the status codes `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/fraud` and `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/possibleFraud` were introduced. Their purpose is to alert (suspected) fraudulent behaviour.

-   The specification for “Discovery within the Swedish eID Framework”
    has been deprecated and requirements referring to this document have
    been updated.

- A clarification to section 5.2 was made stating that conformant
  Identity Providers MUST support the HTTP-POST binding.

- Section 6.2 was updated with requirements for proxy-IdP:s that are expected to include the `<saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>` element holding the entityID of the Identity Provider that provided the authentication of the principal.

**Changes between version 1.2 and version 1.3:**

-   This profile now extends a newer version of the SAML2Int Deployment
    Profile (see <http://saml2int.org/profile/current/>).

-   Clarifications on how entity categories are represented in metadata
    were made to chapters: 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4.

-   Changes were made to chapter 6.1, “Security Requirements”, where the
    profile now requires the entire `<saml2p:Response>` message to
    be signed, as compared to the previous version where the signature
    requirement was put on `<saml2:Assertion>` elements.

-   In chapter 6.2, it is now specified that an Address attribute MUST
    be part of the `<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element. The
    previous version stated SHOULD.

-   Chapter 6.2.1, “Attribute Release Rules”, was introduced to clarify
    how the attribute release process should be handled by an issuing
    entity.

-   A Service Provider is now obliged to explicitly specify the required
    Level of Assurance under which a specific authentication should be
    performed. This is specified in chapter 5.3, “Message Content”, and
    5.4.4, “Authentication Context and Level of Assurance Handling”.

-   The specification “Authentication Context Classes for Levels of
    Assurance for the Swedish eID Framework” has been removed from the
    Swedish eID Framework. The reason for this is that it was proven
    difficult to make use of the `<saml2:AuthnContextDecl>` element
    to store authentication context parameters, and that no commercial,
    or open source, Identity Provider software had support for this
    feature. \[EidAttributes\] now describe how the `authContextParams`
    attribute may be used for the same purpose, and the examples where
    this information was stored under the `<saml2:AuthnContextDecl>`
    element was removed from chapter 6.2, “Message Content”.

-   Chapter 7, “Authentication for Signature”, was introduced to specify
    requirements regarding the process of “authentication for signature”
    where a *Signature Service* requests that a user performing a
    signature authenticates.

**Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2:**

-   This profile now explicitly defines requirements for the use of
    signed authentication request messages, see sections 2.1and 5.2.

-   This profile now allows the HTTP-POST binding to be used for sending
    authentication request messages (see chapter 5.2, “Binding and
    Security Requirements”). The main reason for this is to facilitate
    the use of signed authentication request messages.

-   In chapter 5.4, additional processing requirements for received
    authentication requests were added or changed. These include:

-   Validation of assertion consumer addresses (5.4.1).

-   Clarifications to chapter 5.4.4.

-   Single Sign On processing (5.4.5).

-   This profile now states that “Unsolicited response” messages are not
    accepted by Service Providers due to security reasons, see chapter
    6.1, “Security Requirements”.

-   Changes and additions in chapter 6.2, “Message Content”, for
    responses including:

-   Clarifications about the usage of the `AuthnInstant` attribute of the
    `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element.

-   Specifications of the use of `<saml2:SubjectConfirmation>` in
    assertions.

-   Clarifications on the use of audience restrictions and assertion
    validity.

-   Chapter 6.3, “Processing Requirements”, was added. This chapter
    contains specifications and requirements of how a response message
    should be processed in order to maintain security.

**Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:**

-   In chapter 5.1, “Discovery”, a reference to the specification
    “Discovery within the Swedish eID Framework” \[Eid2Disco\] was
    added.

-   In chapter 5.4.4, a note was added that informs about the need to
    ensure IdP-capabilities regarding level of assurance before issuing
    a request.

-   In chapter 6.2, “Message Content”, an example of how an Identity
    Provider may include an authentication context class declaration was
    provided.

-   Some faulty references were corrected.
