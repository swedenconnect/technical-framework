## 1. Introduction

This profile specifies behavior and options that deployments of the SAML
V2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile
\[[SAML2Prof](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf)\]
are required or permitted to rely on. The profile extends Interoperable
SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Deployment Profile
\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] with requirements
specific for the Swedish eID Framework and specifies deployment details
that are not covered in
\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\].

Readers should be familiar with all relevant reference documents, and
any requirements stated are not repeated unless where deemed necessary
to clarify or highlight a certain issue.

This profile, like \[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\],
addresses the content, exchange, and processing of SAML messages, but
also specifies some deployment details that go beyond that scope, such
as required metadata elements.

Any SAML features specified in referenced SAML documents that are
optional are out of scope of this profile, unless explicitly specified
by this profile.

This profile does not handle requirements regarding algorithms and
different versions of underlying security mechanisms. This information
is distributed by the federation operator in other channels.

<a name="requirements-notation"></a>
### 1.1. Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
\[[RFC2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)\].

The use of SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and RECOMMENDED reflects broad consensus
on deployment practices intended to foster both interoperability and
guarantees of security and confidentiality needed to satisfy the
requirements of many organizations that engage in the use of federated
identity. Deviating may limit a deployment's ability to technically
interoperate without additional negotiation, and should be undertaken
with caution.

<a name="references-to-saml-2.0-standards-and-profiles"></a>
### 1.2. References to SAML 2.0 Standards and Profiles

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 core specification
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\],
the following syntax is used:

-   `<saml2p:Protocolelement>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0
    Protocol namespace.

-   `<saml2:Assertionelement>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0
    Assertion namespace.

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 metadata specifications,
the following syntax is used:

-   `<md:Metadataelement>` – for elements defined in
    \[[SAML2Meta](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf)\].

-   `<mdui:Element>` – for elements defined in
    \[[SAML2MetaUI](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/39441/draft-sstc-saml-metadata-ui-03.pdf)\].

-   `<mdattr:Element>` – for elements defined in
    \[[SAML2MetaAttr](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-metadata-attr.html)\].

When referring to elements from the W3C XML Signature namespace
(`http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig\#`) the following syntax is used:

-   `<ds:Signature>`

<a name="metadata-and-trust-management"></a>
## 2. Metadata and Trust Management

Identity Providers and Service Providers that are part of the federation
for Swedish eID MUST provide a SAML 2.0 Metadata document representing
its entity. Provided metadata MUST conform to
\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] as well as the SAML
V2.0 Metadata Interoperability Profile Version 1.0
\[[MetaIOP](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-metadata-iop.pdf)\].

<a name="requirements-for-metadata-content"></a>
### 2.1. Requirements for Metadata Content

<a name="generic"></a>
#### 2.1.1. Generic

All services that are represented in the Metadata SHALL include a
`<md:Organization>` element with mandatory child elements, which
includes at least one of each of the elements
`<md:OrganizationName>`, `<md:OrganizationDisplayName>` and
`<md:OrganizationURL>`.

The `<md:OrganizationName>` element SHALL hold a registered name of
the organization, which matches the agreement with the federation
operator.

The `<md:OrganizationDisplayName>` element SHALL contain a display
name of the organization and SHALL NOT contain a service name that is
unrelated to the name of the organization.

All services represented in the metadata SHALL include RSA public keys
in the form of a certificate, which supports both signature validation
and encryption. The same public key MAY support both signature
validation and encryption, indicated by an absent `"use"` attribute.

<a name="service-providers"></a>
#### 2.1.2. Service Providers

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of a Service Provider’s
entity descriptor SHOULD contain one entity category attribute
\[[EntCat](http://macedir.org/entity-category/)\] that holds at least
one attribute value representing a service entity category as defined in
\[Eid2EntCat\], identifying the Service Provider needs in relation to
identity services.

The example below illustrates how an entity declares the service entity
category identifier **`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr`** in its
metadata.

```
<md:Extensions>
  <mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
    <saml2:Attribute Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category"
                     NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
                     xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
      <saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">
        http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr
      </saml2:AttributeValue>
    </saml2:Attribute>
  </mdattr:EntityAttributes>
</md:Extensions>
```

Any needs for particular attributes from Identify Providers, when
present, MUST be expressed through present service entity categories in
combination with `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements in the Service
Provider metadata. The `<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements in the
Service Provider metadata, when present, hold a list of requested and/or
required attributes. This list of attributes MUST be interpreted in the
context of present service entity categories defined in \[EidEntCat\].

Metadata for a Service Provider SHALL contain an `<mdui:UIInfo>`
extension, extending the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element. This
`<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL at least contain a
`<mdui:DisplayName>` element with the language attribute `sv`
(Swedish), representing the Service Provider name that has been approved
by the federation operator. The `<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL also
contain a reference to a logotype image (`<mdui:Logo>`) and SHOULD
contain a `<mdui:Description>` element with the language attribute
`sv` (Swedish).

It is RECOMMENDED that the above elements represented in Swedish also be
represented with the language attribute `en` (English).

A Service Provider MAY sign authentication request messages sent to
Identity Providers. A Service Provider that signs authentication
requests messages MAY also ensure that a receiving Identity Provider
will only accept valid signed requests from this Service Provider by
assigning the `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the
`<md:SPSSODescriptor>` to a value of `true`.

Section E7, “Metadata for Agreeing to Sign Authentication Requests”, of
\[SAML v2.0 Errata 05\] specifies the following concerning the
`AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute:

> Optional attribute that indicates whether the
> `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages sent by this service provider
> will be signed. If omitted, the value is assumed to be false. A value
> of false (or omission of this attribute) does not imply that the
> service provider will never sign its requests or that a signed request
> should be considered an error. However, an identity provider that
> receives an unsigned `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message from a
> service provider whose metadata contains this attribute with a value
> of true MUST return a SAML error response and MUST NOT fulfill the
> request.

Furthermore, a Service Provider MAY require assertions that are issued
to it, to be signed. This is done by assigning the `WantAssertionsSigned`
attribute of the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` to a value of `true`.

Note that the response message that carries the assertion will always be
signed, so the Service Provider should only require signed assertions in
case that it wants to preserve the proof of authenticity of an assertion
separate from the response.

<a name="identity-providers"></a>
#### 2.1.3. Identity Providers

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of an Identity Provider’s
entity descriptor SHOULD contain one entity category attribute
\[[EntCat](http://macedir.org/entity-category/)\] that holds at least
one attribute value representing a service entity category as defined in
\[EidEntCat\], defining the Identity Provider ability to deliver
assertions.

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of an Identity Provider’s
metadata SHALL contain an attribute according to
\[[SAML2IAP](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-assurance-profile.html)\]
with `Name="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:attribute:assurance-certification"`
holding at least one attribute value identifying a Level of Assurance
(LoA) level for which the Identity Provider has been approved and where
the value is one of the identifiers defined in section 3.1.1 of
\[EidRegistry\] and whose meaning are defined in \[EidTillit\].

Metadata for an Identity Provider SHALL contain an `<mdui:UIInfo>`
extension, extending the `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element. This
`<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL at least contain a
`<mdui:DisplayName>` element with the language attribute `sv`
(Swedish), representing the Identity Provider service name that has been
approved by the federation operator. The `<mdui:UIInfo>` element
SHALL also contain a reference to a logotype image (`<mdui:Logo>`)
and SHOULD contain a `<mdui:Description>` element with the language
attribute `sv` (Swedish).

It is RECOMMENDED that the above elements represented in Swedish also be
represented with the language attribute `en` (English).

An Identity Provider MAY require authentication request messages to be
signed. This is indicated by assigning the
`WantAuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the `<md:IDPSSPDescriptor>`
element to a value of `true`. See further section E7, “Metadata for
Agreeing to Sign Authentication Requests”, of \[[SAML v2.0 Errata
05](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/errata05/os/saml-v2.0-errata05-os.html)\].

<a name="signature-service"></a>
#### 2.1.4. Signature Service

The Signature Service within the framework for Swedish eID is a Service
Provider with specific requirements concerning its representation in
metadata. Its entry in metadata SHALL contain an `<mdui:UIInfo>`
element, extending the `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element. This
`<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL at least contain a
`<mdui:DisplayName>` element with the language attribute `sv`
(Swedish), representing the signature service that has been approved by
the federation operator.

The `<mdui:UIInfo>` element SHALL also contain a reference to a
logotype image (`<mdui:Logo>`) and at least contain one
`<mdui:Description>` element with the language attribute `sv`
(Swedish), providing a description of the service according to
requirements provided by the federation operator.

It is RECOMMENDED that the above elements represented in Swedish also be
represented with the language attribute `en` (English).

The `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element of a Signature Service SP
entity descriptor SHALL include the service type entity category
identifier **`http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice`** \[EidEntCat\]
as a value to the entity category attribute
\[[EntCat](http://macedir.org/entity-category/)\].

```
<mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">`
  <saml2:Attribute Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category"
                   NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
                   xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
    <saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr</saml2:AttributeValue>
    <saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice</saml2:AttributeValue>
  </saml2:Attribute>
</mdattr:EntityAttributes>
```

*Entity attributes for a Signature Service SP.*

A Signature Service MUST assign the `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute of the
`<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element to `true`. This requirement ensures
that the Signature Service always signs its authentication requests in
order for the request to be accepted by the Identity Provider. The
federation operator will enforce that all Service Providers that operate
as Signature Services have this attribute set.

<a name="name-identifiers"></a>
## 3. Name Identifiers

Identity Providers and Service Providers MUST support both the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` and the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` name identifier
formats as specified in
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\].

Identity Providers SHALL default to use the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` name identifier
format in cases where a Service Provider has not specified the name
identifier to use (via the `<md:NameIDFormat>` element of the
Service Provider metadata entry, or via the `Format` attribute of the
`<saml2p:NameIDPolicy>` element of the authentication request
message).

<a name="attributes"></a>
## 4. Attributes

Attribute specifications for the Swedish eID Framework is defined in
\[EidAttributes\].

The content of `<saml2:AttributeValue>` elements exchanged via any
SAML 2.0 messages or assertions SHOULD be limited to a single child text
node.

For requirements regarding attribute inclusion in SAML assertions, see
section [6.2.1](#attribute-release-rules), “[Attribute Release Rules](#attribute-release-rules)”, below.

<a name="authentication-requests"></a>
## 5. Authentication Requests

<a name="discovery"></a>
### 5.1. Discovery

Currently, this deployment profile does not impose any requirements of
how the process of discovery is implemented by Service Providers wishing
to display user interfaces for selection of Identity Providers for end
users.

<a name="binding-and-security-requirements"></a>
### 5.2. Binding and Security Requirements

The endpoints, at which an Identity Provider receives a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, and all subsequent exchanges with
the user agent, MUST be protected by TLS/SSL
(\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] specifies SHOULD).

\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] specifies that a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message MUST be communicated to the Identity
Provider using the HTTP-REDIRECT binding. This profile will also allow
the usage of the HTTP-POST binding for sending
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages (see section 3.5 of
\[[SAML2Bind](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf)\]),
meaning that Identity Providers conformant with this profile MUST support
the HTTP-POST binding.

An Identity Provider that requires `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages
to be signed MUST not accept messages that are not signed, or where the
verification of the signature fails. In these cases the Identity
Provider MUST respond with an error.

An Identity Provider that itself does not require authentication
messages to be signed MUST still accept and verify signed request
messages from Service Providers that indicate, in their metadata, that
they sign request messages (see [2.1.2](#service-providers) above). If this signature
verification fails, the Identity Provider MUST return a SAML error
response and MUST NOT fulfill the request.

An Identity Provider that receives a request message that is not signed
from a Service Provider that has indicated, in its metadata, that it
will only send signed request messages (see [2.1.2](#service-providers) above) MUST respond
with an error.

The signature for authentication request messages is applied differently
depending on the binding. The HTTP-REDIRECT binding requires the
signature to be applied to the URL-encoded value rather than being
placed within the XML-message (see section 3.4.4.1 of
\[[SAML2Bind](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf)\]).
For the HTTP-POST binding the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element MUST
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2:AuthnRequest>`.

<a name="message-content"></a>
### 5.3. Message Content

\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] specifies that a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message SHOULD contain an
`AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying the desired response
location. The Service Provider MUST NOT use any other values for this
attribute than those listed in its metadata record as
`<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements for the HTTP-POST binding
(see section 4.1.6 of
\[[SAML2Prof](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf)\]).

The `Destination` attribute of the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
MUST contain the URL to which the Service Provider has instructed the
user agent to deliver the request. This is useful to prevent malicious
forwarding of signed requests from being accepted by unintended Identity
Providers.

A Service Provider SHOULD explicitly specify one requested
authentication context element (`<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>`),
containing one or more `<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` elements that
each contains an authentication context URI<sup>1</sup> representing a defined
Level of Assurance under which the authentication process should be
performed.

A present `<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` element MUST specify
exact matching by means of either an absent `Comparison` attribute or a
`Comparison` attribute with the value set to `exact`. This means that the
Identity Provider is forced to return an assertion with exactly one of
the requested `<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` in the request as the
declared `<saml2:AuthnContext>`, or return an error response. If the
Service Provider requires the Identity Provider to return specifically
one out of a selection of acceptable authentication context URIs, then
all of these URIs MUST be included in the request.

The requested authentication context SHOULD be consistent with at least
one of the service entity categories \[EidEntCat\] declared in the
Service Provider’s metadata entry. See further [section 5.4.4](#authentication-context-and-level-of-assurance-handling) below.

```
<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext Comparison="exact">
  <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
</saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>
```

*Example of how an Authentication Context URI identifier representing a
requested Level of Assurance is included in an authentication request
message.*

```
<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext Comparison="exact">
  <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
  <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-nf-sub</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
</saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>
```

*Example of how several Authentication Context URIs are included in an
authentication request message. In this case, the Service Provider
states that it requests the authentication to be performed according to
either the LoA3 URI defined within the Swedish eID Framework or the
substantial level for notified eIDs defined within the eIDAS Framework.*

Identity Providers conformant with this profile MUST support the
`ForceAuthn` and `IsPassive` attributes received in
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages.

Service Providers SHOULD include the `ForceAuthn` attribute in all
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages and explicitly set its value to
`true` or `false`, and not rely on its default value. The reason for this is
to avoid accidental SSO.

> \[1\]: See section 3.1.1 of \[EidRegistry\].

<a name="processing-requirements"></a>
### 5.4. Processing Requirements

<a name="validation-of-destination"></a>
#### 5.4.1. Validation of Destination

An Identity Provider receiving a `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
MUST verify that the `Destination` attribute is present, and that it is
consistent with URLs configured in the Identity Provider’s metadata.

<a name="validation-of-assertion-consumer-addresses"></a>
#### 5.4.2. Validation of Assertion Consumer Addresses

If the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute is present in the
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, its value MUST be verified to be
consistent with one of the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements
having the HTTP-POST binding found in the Service Provider’s metadata
entry. If this is not the case, the request must be rejected.

If the attribute is not present in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>`
message, the Identity Provider MUST obtain the desired response location
from the Service Provider’s metadata entry. This location is found in an
`<md:AssertionConsumerService>` element with HTTP-POST binding that
is marked as default (has the `isDefault` attribute set), or if no element
has the `isDefault` attribute set, the one with the lowest index value
(see section 2.4.4.1 of \[SAML2Meta\]).

Section 8.2 of \[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\]
specifies how comparisons between the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` value
and the values found in the Service Provider’s metadata should be
performed.

<a name="identity-provider-user-interface"></a>
#### 5.4.3. Identity Provider User Interface

Where the requirements for user interfaces defined for the federation
requires presentation of information elements related to the Service
Provider, these information elements MUST be obtained from the
`<mdui:UIInfo>` element in the Service Provider’s metadata entry.
Implementers of this profile MUST be capable of handling display
information stored in the `<mdui:DisplayName>`, `<mdui:Logo>`
and the `<mdui:Description>` elements.

<a name="authentication-context-and-level-of-assurance-handling"></a>
#### 5.4.4. Authentication Context and Level of Assurance Handling

This framework defines a number of authentication context identifiers
(URI), where each such identifier specifies a defined Level of Assertion
and may define specific requirements on the authentication process.
There can be multiple authentication context URIs representing the same
Level of Assertion, but one authentication context URI always identifies
one defined Level of Assurance. For example, requests for authentication
from a Signature Service that requires a sign message to be displayed as
part of the authentication process will request a different
authentication context URI (see [section 7](#authentication-for-signature)) than a typical Service
Provider just requesting authentication of a user, even if the requested
Level of Assurance is the same.

Identity Providers SHALL exclusively use one of the requested
authentication contexts in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` in the
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element under the
`<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` element, when present, to determine
the requested authentication process and Level of Assurance. The
Identity Provider SHALL respond with an error `<saml2p:StatusCode>`
with the value `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester`
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\]
if no requested authentication context is supported. If no requested
authentication context is present in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>`,
the Identity Provider MAY return the result of a default authentication
process that is consistent with the Identity Providers metadata.

**Note**: The Identity Provider does not have to consider the service
entity categories (\[EidEntCat\]) declared in the Service Provider’s
metadata entry when determining the requested authentication context
under which the authentication should be performed. The purpose of the
service entity categories is primarily to support service matching in
discovery services and attribute release policies in Identity Providers.
Significant Identity Provider products and software are not equipped to
use service entity category information to determine the requested
authentication context.

<a name="single-sign-on-processing"></a>
#### 5.4.5. Single Sign On Processing

An Identity Provider conformant to this profile MAY issue an assertion
relying on a previously established security context (active session)
instead of authenticating the user. However, the Identity Provider MUST
NOT re-use an already existing security context in the following cases:

-   When the security context has expired, i.e., the time elapsed since
    the security context was established is too long given the
    SSO-policy stipulated by the federation.

-   When the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` contains a `ForceAuthn` attribute
    with the value of `true`.

-   If the original authentication process, which led to the
    establishment of the security context, was performed using a weaker
    Level of Assurance that what is requested in the current
    `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message.

If the Identity Provider user interface contains some sort of user
consent, or information, concerning which attributes, or any other
information, that is included in an assertion being issued, the Identity
Provider SHOULD preserve this functionality if a
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message requesting a different set of
attributes (or any other information) compared to what was delivered in
the assertion at the time of establishing the security context. The
Identity Provider may require re-authentication or display a user
interface for consent/information in these cases.

<a name="authentication-responses"></a>
## 6. Authentication Responses

<a name="security-requirements"></a>
### 6.1. Security Requirements

The endpoint(s) at which a Service Provider receives a
`<saml2p:Response>` message MUST be protected by TLS/SSL
(\[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\] states SHOULD).

The `<saml2p:Response>` message issued by the Identity Provider MUST
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2p:Response>` element.

The `<saml2:Assertion>` element issued by the Identity Provider MAY
be signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the
`<saml2:Assertion>`. If a Service Provider requires signed
assertions, by assigning the `WantAssertionsSigned` attribute of its
metadata record (see [chapter 2.1.2](#service-providers)), the Identity Provider MUST sign
assertions issued to this Service Provider (as well as the response
message as stated above).

Identity Providers SHALL utilize XML Encryption and return a
`<saml2:EncryptedAssertion>` element in the `<saml2p:Response>`
message. The elements `<saml2:EncryptedID>` and
`<saml2:EncryptedAttribute>` MUST NOT be used; instead the entire
assertion should be encrypted.

Service Providers SHOULD NOT accept unsolicited `<saml2p:Response>`
messages (i.e., responses that are not the result of an earlier
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message). Service Providers that do accept
unsolicited response messages MUST ensure, by other means, that the
security and processing requirements of this profile ([section 6.3](#processing-requirements)) can
be fully satisfied. \[[SAML2Int](http://saml2int.org/profile/current/)\]
allows the use of unsolicited responses, but this profile has more
strict security and processing requirements that make the use of
unsolicited responses violate these requirements.

<a name="message-content2"></a>
### 6.2. Message Content

The `<saml2:Response>` message MUST contain an `<saml2:Issuer>`
element containing the unique identifier (entityID) of the issuing
Identity Provider.

The `AuthnInstant` attribute of the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element
MUST be assigned the time when the actual authentication took place.
This time may differ from the `IssueInstant` attribute of the assertion
itself, which holds the time when the assertion was issued. This is
especially important in cases of re-use of already established security
contexts at the Identity Provider side (Single Sign On).

Each identity assertion MUST have a `<saml:Subject>` element that
specifies the principal that is the subject of all of the statements in
the assertion.

The value of the `<saml:NameID>` element under the
`<saml:Subject>` element MUST hold a pseudonym identifier of the
subject, which SHALL be:

-   Unique for the IdP – SP combination being the issuer and recipient
    for the assertion.

-   Constructed in a manner that does not reveal the registered identity
    of the subject.

The `<saml2:Subject>` element MUST contain one
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmation>` element containing a `Method` of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer`. This element MUST contain a
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element that contains at least the
following:

-   An `InResponseTo` attribute matching the request’s ID.

-   A `Recipient` attribute containing the Service Provider’s assertion
    consumer service URL (see sections [5.3](#message-content) and [5.4.1](#validation-of-destination)).

-   A `NotOnOrAfter` attribute containing a time instant at which the
    subject no longer can be confirmed.

The `<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` MUST also contain an `Address`
attribute containing the network address from which an attesting entity
(user) can present the assertion.

The assertion MUST contain a `<saml2:Conditions>` element containing
the following attributes and elements:

-   A `<saml2:AudienceRestriction>` element including the requesting
    Service Provider’s unique identifier (entityID) as an
    `<saml2:Audience>` value.

-   A `NotBefore` attribute specifying the earliest time instant at which
    the assertion is valid.

-   A `NotOnOrAfter` attribute specifying the time instant when the
    assertion expires.

An Identity Provider conformant to this profile MUST, in its issued
assertions, include an authentication context URI indicating under which
Level of Assurance the assertion was issued. This identifier MUST be
placed under the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element as the value of an
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element that is part of the
`<saml2:AuthnContext>` element.

```
<saml2:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant="2013-03-15T09:22:00" SessionIndex="b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac">
  <saml2:AuthnContext>
    <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
    ...
  </saml2:AuthnContext>
</saml2:AuthnStatement>
```

*Example of how an Authentication Context URI identifier representing a
Level of Assurance is included in an authentication statement.*

An Identity Provider that acts as a proxy for other Identity Providers SHOULD include the `<saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>` element under the `<saml2:AuthnContext>` element. This element will contain the entityID of the Identity Provider that was involved in authenticating the principal.

```
<saml2:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant="2013-03-15T09:22:00" SessionIndex="b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac">
  <saml2:AuthnContext>
    ...
    <saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>http://idp.company.com/auth</saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>
  </saml2:AuthnContext>
</saml2:AuthnStatement>
```
*Example of how the entityID of an Identity Provider that provided the authentication for the principal is included in an authentication statement.*

<a name="attribute-release-rules"></a>
#### 6.2.1. Attribute Release Rules

An Identity Provider determines which attributes to include in the
`<saml2:AttributeStatement>` element of an assertion based on the
Service Provider requirements and its agreements with the user being
authenticated. Service Provider attribute preferences and requirements
are specified by the service entity categories \[EidEntCat\] and
requested attributes in the `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element
declared in the Service Provider metadata. A service entity category
specifies the attribute set (as defined in \[EidAttributes\]) that is
requested for the attribute release process.

An Identity Provider declares service entity categories in order to
publish its ability to deliver attributes according to certain attribute
sets. For all declared service entity categories, the Identity Provider
MUST possess the ability to deliver the mandatory attributes of the
underlying attribute set. See \[EidEntCat\] and \[EidAttributes\] for
details.

The Service Provider is responsible for checking that an Identity
Provider is capable of providing necessary attributes before sending a
request and to verify that it received all attributes necessary for
providing a requested service. Checks whether an Identity Provider is
capable of fulfilling the needs of a Service Provider can be done either
by relying on a discovery process to filter out non-conformant Identity
Providers, and/or by examining the metadata of Identity providers. An
Identity Provider receiving a request for more attributes than it can
provide SHOULD return an assertion with the attributes it can provide
according to its defined attribute release policy, leaving it up to the
Service Provider to decide how to proceed, e.g., by denying service to
the authenticated user, provide limited services or to use other
resources to collect necessary attributes.

<a name="processing-requirements2"></a>
### 6.3. Processing Requirements

This profile mandates a correct processing of a `<saml2p:Response>`
message in order to ensure proper protection from the security threats
described in
\[[SAML2Sec](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-sec-consider-2.0-os.pdf)\].
Processing requirements are listed in
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\],
\[[SAML2Prof](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf)\]
and
\[[SAML2Sec](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-sec-consider-2.0-os.pdf)\].
This document will list the necessary requirements that apply to this
profile.

After the Service Provider has encrypted the assertion from the received
response message the following requirements apply. Any verification that
fails MUST lead to that the Service Provider rejects the response
message and does not use the assertion.

Some of the processing requirements below are defined in order to
protect from MITM- or MITB-attacks<sup>2</sup> were unsigned authentication
requests may be changed before being sent to the Identity Provider.
However, a Service Provider MUST implement all of the specified
processing requirements even if it sends signed authentication request
messages.

> \[2\]: MITM stands for ”man in the middle” and MITB stands for ”man in the browser”.

<a name="signature-validation"></a>
#### 6.3.1. Signature Validation

The signature present on the `<saml2p:Response>` message, and
optionally on the `<saml2:Assertion>`, MUST be successfully
verified.

The public key being used to verify the signature MUST appear in the
issuing Identity Provider’s metadata record (as a
`<ds:X509Certificate>` or `<ds:KeyValue>` element under the
`<ds:KeyInfo>` element).

<a name="subject-confirmation"></a>
#### 6.3.2. Subject Confirmation

Based on the `InResponseTo` attribute of the
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` the Subject Provider MUST be able
to obtain the corresponding `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, or a
secure context containing corresponding information from the request
(for future processing of the assertion).

The `Recipient` attribute from the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element MUST match the location to
which the `<saml2p:Response>` message was delivered **and** match
the value the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute included in the
request message, or if this attribute was not provided in the request
message, the default response location specified in the Service
Provider’s metadata entry, as described in [section 5.4.2](#validation-of-assertion-consumer-addresses).

The time from the `NotOnOrAfter` attribute from the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` MUST NOT have passed compared with
the time instant at which the subject is confirmed (i.e., when the
assertion is validated). A reasonable allowable clock skew between the
providers should be taken in account.

If the `Address` attribute is assigned to the bearer
`<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element, the Service Provider MAY
choose to check the user agent’s client address against it. Practical
issues regarding the Service Provider’s network setup and the risk of
introducing false negatives makes this an optional step in the
validation phase.

<a name="conditions"></a>
#### 6.3.3. Conditions

The Service Provider MUST assert that the value of the
`<saml2:Audience>` element under the
`<saml2:AudienceRestriction>` element matches the unique entityID of
the Service Provider.

The Service Provider MUST verify that the time instant at which the
assertion is validated is within the range given by the `NotBefore` and
`NotOnOrAfter` attributes of the `<saml2:Conditions>` element
(allowing for a reasonable clock skew). See also the processing of the
`NotOnOrAfter` attribute in [section 6.3.2](#subject-confirmation).

<a name="the-authentication-statement"></a>
#### 6.3.4. The Authentication Statement

The Service Provider MUST assert that the `<saml2:AuthnStatement>`
contains a `<saml2:AuthnContext>` element that holds a
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element having as its value the
authentication context URI indicating under which Level of Assurance the
authentication was performed. The Level of Assurance declared in the
assertion MUST be equal to, or stronger<sup>3</sup> than, the Level of Assurance
requested by the Service Provider.

> \[3\]: A stronger Level of Assurance identifier is simply a LoA having a higher value than what it is compared with, i.e., `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa4` is stronger than `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3`.

<a name="general-security-validation"></a>
#### 6.3.5. General Security Validation

In order to protect itself from replay attacks, the Service Provider
MUST ensure that the same assertion is not processed more than once
within the time it is valid (with respect to the `NotOnOrAfter` attribute
of the `<saml2:Conditions>` element).

In order to prevent stolen assertions and user impersonation, the
Service Provider SHOULD implement a validation that rejects an assertion
if the time given it its IssueInstant attribute compared to the time
when the response message is received is too great. This time is
typically on the order of seconds, and limits the time window when a
stolen assertion could be used.

If the Service Provider included the attribute `ForceAuthn` with a value
of `true` in the authentication request, the Service Provider SHOULD
ensure that the `AuthnInstant` attribute of the
`<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element is greater than the time when the
request was sent (allowing for a reasonable clock skew).

<a name="error-responses"></a>
### 6.4. Error Responses

If the Identity Provider returns an error, it MUST NOT include any
assertions in the `<saml2p:Response>` message.

An Identity Provider conformant with this profile SHOULD NOT make use of
any other `<saml2p:StatusCode>` values than those specified in
section 3.2.2.2 of
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\]
or in section 3.1.4 of \[EidRegistry\]. The top-level
`<saml2p:StatusCode>` value may only be one of the following error
identifiers:

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester` – The request could not
    be performed due to an error on the part of the Service Provider.

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder` – The request could not
    be performed due to an error on the part of the Identity Provider.

-   `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:VersionMismatch` – The Identity
    Provider could not process the request because the version of the
    request message was incorrect.

If the user cancels an authentication process the Identity Provider
SHOULD indicate this by assigning the second-level status code to
`http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/cancel`.

If an Identity Provider displays information describing an error in its
user interface it MUST also offer ways for the end user to confirm this
information (for example, by including an OK-button). When the end user
acknowledges taking part of the information (i.e., clicks on the OK-button),
the `<saml2p:Response>` message is posted back to the Service
Provider according to the HTTP POST binding
\[[SAML2Bind](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf)\].

If an Identity Provider detects suspicious fraudulent behaviour or if any of its security checks alerts a (possible) fraud, the Identity Provider MUST NOT issue an assertion but instead display an error message. After the end user confirms this error message, the error message posted back to the Service Provider SHOULD contain a second-level status code set to `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/fraud` or `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/possibleFraud` (depending on whether the Identity Provider aborted the authentication due to a determined or suspected fraud).

<a name="authentication-for-signature"></a>
## 7. Authentication for Signature

“DSS Extension for Federated Central Signing Services”, \[EidDSS\],
defines an extension to the OASIS DSS protocol for providing centralized
Signature Services within the Swedish eID Framework. This specification
defines the communication between a *Signature Requestor*<sup>4</sup> and a
Signature Service, but does not cover SAML specific requirements
regarding the user authentication phase that is part of the signature
process.

This section defines requirements on the SAML authentication process
when authentication is requested by a Signature Service, acting as a
SAML Service Provider. All requirements regarding user authentication
specified earlier in this profile are still valid. This section extends
these requirements for the “authentication for signature” process.

> \[4\]: A Signature Requestor is a Service Provider within the federation to which the user previously has logged in to and from where the user initiates a signature operation.

<a name="authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services"></a>
### 7.1. Authentication Context URIs for Signature Services

The Swedish eID Framework defines additional authentication context URIs
to be used in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` and `<saml2:Assertion>`
elements during “authentication for signature”. These authentication
context URIs are applicable when the Identity Provider is required to
display a sign message as part of the authentication process. These URIs
are:

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa2-sigmessage`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3-sigmessage`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa4-sigmessage`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-low-sigm`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-sub-sigm`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-high-sigm`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-nf-sub-sigm`

-   `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/eidas-nf-high-sigm`

These URIs extend the corresponding authentication context URIs used to
represent Level of Assurance identifiers (see section 3.1.1 of
\[EidRegistry\]) with requirements listed in the sections below. A
Signature Service MAY use any of the defined authentication context
URIs. The URIs listed above are only used when there is an explicit
requirement for the Identity Provider to display a sign message provided
in the authentication request.

<a name="authentication-requests2"></a>
### 7.2. Authentication Requests

Authentication requests from a Signature Service SHALL meet the
following requirements:

-   The `ForceAuthn` attribute of the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element
    MUST be set to `true`.

-   The `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` element MUST be signed. This MUST
    also be indicated in the Signature Service metadata record using the
    `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute (see [section 2.1.4](#signature-service)).

An Identity Provider that accepts an `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
from a Service Provider that has indicated that it is a Signature
Service<sup>5</sup> MUST provide a user interface that is indicating that the
end user is performing a signature.

> \[5\]: An Identity Provider identifies a Service Provider as a Signature Service if it declares the `http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice` URI as a service type entity category in its metadata (see [2.1.4](#signature-service)).

<a name="requesting-display-of-signature-message"></a>
#### 7.2.1. Requesting Display of Signature Message

\[EidDSS\_Profile\] specifies that a Signature Requestor may include a
`SignMessage` element (as defined by \[EidDSS\]) in a signature request.
This element holds a message that the Identity Provider, which is
responsible for “authentication for signature”, should present to the
user that is performing the signature.

A Signature Service MAY request the Identity Provider to show a sign
message to the user by including the `SignMessage` element from the
signature request as a child element to an `<saml2p:Extensions>`
element in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message (see section 3.2.1 of
\[[SAML2Core](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)\]).

If the `SignMessage` element from the signature request includes a
`MustShow` attribute with the value `true`, the Signature Service MUST
require that the provided sign message is displayed by the Identity
Provider, by including an authentication context URI (as defined in
[section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services) above) to the `<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element
that is part of the `<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` element of the
`<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message.

Identity Providers SHALL advertise supported authentication contexts
defined by the URIs listed in [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services), by including the URIs of
supported authentication contexts as EntityAttributes of the type
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:attribute:assurance-certification` in its
metadata.

```
<md:Extensions>
  <mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
    <saml:Attribute Name="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:attribute:assurance-certification"
                    NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
                    xmlns:saml="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">

</md:Extensions>
```
*Example of how an Identity Provider advertises its support for LoA3
authentication (including support for displaying of sign messages).*

Identity Providers processing a request with a requested authentication
context identified by any of the URIs listed in 7.1 SHALL meet the
following requirements (in addition to other general requirements
associated with requests from signature services:

-   The authentication request SHALL contain a sign message that can be
    extracted by the Identity Provider. If the Identity Provider fails
    to locate, decrypt or extract the sign message in clear text form,
    it must return an error response.

-   The Identity Provider MUST display the sign message to the user in a
    manner that is consistent with the data format of the sign message.
    If necessary, the Identity Provider MUST process defined filtering
    rules on the message. If the present message format is not supported
    or the sign message for any reason cannot be displayed in a proper
    manner, the Identity Provider must return an error response.

-   If authentication and sign message confirmation by the user was
    successful, the Identity Provider MUST include the authentication
    context URI from the list in 7.1 in the assertion that is consistent
    with the authentication context requested in the authentication
    request.

-   The Identity Provider MUST NOT return an assertion without
    performing authentication process consistent with the requested
    authentication context which includes display of a sign message,
    even if the request has no present `ForceAuthn` attribute or includes
    a `ForceAuthn` attribute set to the value `false`.

<a name="authentication-responses2"></a>
### 7.3. Authentication Responses

By including an authentication context URI listed in [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services) (sign
message URI) in SAML assertion under the
`<saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>` element of the
`<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element in the response, the Identity
Provider asserts that it has successfully displayed the sign message
received in the request for the user and that the user has accepted to
sign under the context of this sign message<sup>6</sup>.

An Identity Provider MUST NOT return an authentication context URI in an
assertion, other than those listed in [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services), if the request
included one of these URIs as the requested authentication context. If
the Identity Provider failed to display the sign message or the user
failed to accept it, and the request indicated that the sign message
MUST be displayed, then the Identity Provider MUST return an error
response with the status code
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:AuthnFailed`.

> \[6\]: As defined in [section 5.3](#message-content), only exact matching of authentication context URIs are allowed. As a consequence the Identity Provider can only assert a sign message authentication context URI according to [section 7.1](#authentication-context-uris-for-signature-services) if such an authentication context was requested in the authentication request. It is therefore the responsibility of the Signature Service requesting authentication to always request a sign message authentication context if it requires evidence that the sign message has been displayed to the user.

## 9. Changes between versions

**Changes between version 1.3 and version 1.4:**

-   Version 1.3 of this profile stated that a
    `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message MUST contain an
    `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying the desired
    response location. It has shown that this requirement aggravates
    interoperability since some of the major providers of Service
    Provider software do not fully support this attribute. Furthermore,
    the requirement does increase security since an Identity Provider
    may only post response messages to locations registered in the
    `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements of the Service Provider
    metadata entry. Therefore, chapter 5.3, “Message Content”, has been
    changed to state that the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message SHOULD
    contain an `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute. Changes have also
    been made to sections 5.4.2 and 6.3.2 where processing requirements
    were updated.

-   In section 5.3, a clarification regarding specifying more than one
    authentication context URI was made.

-   In section 7.1, a set of authentication context URIs for the eIDAS
    Framework was added.

-   In section 6.4, the requirement to use the sub-level status code
    `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/cancel` was added. This status
    should be used to indicate a cancelled operation.
    
- In section 6.4, the status codes `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/fraud` and `http://id.elegnamnden.se/status/1.0/possibleFraud` were introduced. Their purpose is to alert (suspected) fraudulent behaviour.

-   The specification for “Discovery within the Swedish eID Framework”
    has been deprecated and requirements referring to this document have
    been updated.
    
- A clarification to section 5.2 was made stating that conformant
  Identity Providers MUST support the HTTP-POST binding.
  
- Section 6.2 was updated with requirements for proxy-IdP:s that are expected to include the `<saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>` element holding the entityID of the Identity Provider that provided the authentication of the principal.

**Changes between version 1.2 and version 1.3:**

-   This profile now extends a newer version of the SAML2Int Deployment
    Profile (see <http://saml2int.org/profile/current/>).

-   Clarifications on how entity categories are represented in metadata
    were made to chapters: 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4.

-   Changes were made to chapter 6.1, “Security Requirements”, where the
    profile now requires the entire `<saml2p:Response>` message to
    be signed, as compared to the previous version where the signature
    requirement was put on `<saml2:Assertion>` elements.

-   In chapter 6.2, it is now specified that an Address attribute MUST
    be part of the `<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element. The
    previous version stated SHOULD.

-   Chapter 6.2.1, “Attribute Release Rules”, was introduced to clarify
    how the attribute release process should be handled by an issuing
    entity.

-   A Service Provider is now obliged to explicitly specify the required
    Level of Assurance under which a specific authentication should be
    performed. This is specified in chapter 5.3, “Message Content”, and
    5.4.4, “Authentication Context and Level of Assurance Handling”.

-   The specification “Authentication Context Classes for Levels of
    Assurance for the Swedish eID Framework” has been removed from the
    Swedish eID Framework. The reason for this is that it was proven
    difficult to make use of the `<saml2:AuthnContextDecl>` element
    to store authentication context parameters, and that no commercial,
    or open source, Identity Provider software had support for this
    feature. \[EidAttributes\] now describe how the `authContextParams`
    attribute may be used for the same purpose, and the examples where
    this information was stored under the `<saml2:AuthnContextDecl>`
    element was removed from chapter 6.2, “Message Content”.

-   Chapter 7, “Authentication for Signature”, was introduced to specify
    requirements regarding the process of “authentication for signature”
    where a *Signature Service* requests that a user performing a
    signature authenticates.

**Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2:**

-   This profile now explicitly defines requirements for the use of
    signed authentication request messages, see sections 2.1and 5.2.

-   This profile now allows the HTTP-POST binding to be used for sending
    authentication request messages (see chapter 5.2, “Binding and
    Security Requirements”). The main reason for this is to facilitate
    the use of signed authentication request messages.

-   In chapter 5.4, additional processing requirements for received
    authentication requests were added or changed. These include:

-   Validation of assertion consumer addresses (5.4.1).

-   Clarifications to chapter 5.4.4.

-   Single Sign On processing (5.4.5).

-   This profile now states that “Unsolicited response” messages are not
    accepted by Service Providers due to security reasons, see chapter
    6.1, “Security Requirements”.

-   Changes and additions in chapter 6.2, “Message Content”, for
    responses including:

-   Clarifications about the usage of the `AuthnInstant` attribute of the
    `<saml2:AuthnStatement>` element.

-   Specifications of the use of `<saml2:SubjectConfirmation>` in
    assertions.

-   Clarifications on the use of audience restrictions and assertion
    validity.

-   Chapter 6.3, “Processing Requirements”, was added. This chapter
    contains specifications and requirements of how a response message
    should be processed in order to maintain security.

**Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:**

-   In chapter 5.1, “Discovery”, a reference to the specification
    “Discovery within the Swedish eID Framework” \[Eid2Disco\] was
    added.

-   In chapter 5.4.4, a note was added that informs about the need to
    ensure IdP-capabilities regarding level of assurance before issuing
    a request.

-   In chapter 6.2, “Message Content”, an example of how an Identity
    Provider may include an authentication context class declaration was
    provided.

-   Some faulty references were corrected.
