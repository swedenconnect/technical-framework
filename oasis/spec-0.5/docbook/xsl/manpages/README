Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some minimal details (contributed by Barry Rountree)
about the behavior of the manpages stylesheets.

  The first <refname> found is used to create the
  file name of the man page.

  The contents of <refentrytitle> are converted to
  ALL CAPS and used, with <manvolnum>, to decorate the
  bottom right and top corners of the page.

  Any <indexterm> is not used in man-page output.

  In order to document two or more items using the
  same page, add additional refnames to <refnamediv>.
  Each addtiona. refname will generate a small file
  that points to (via the magic of *roff)

    man[manvolnum]/[primaryRefname].gz

More detailed how-to information about processing DocBook XML
documents for man-page output will be available in the future.
Somewhere. Written by someone...

A short history of the DocBook manpages stylesheets
-----------------------------------------------------------------

October 2001 - September 2002: "The Silver Age"
  Martijn van Beers <lotr@users.sourceforge.net> contributes XSL
  stylesheets[1] for converting DocBook documents to *roff man pages,
  and maintains them in the [cvs]/docbook/contrib/xsl/db2man area
  of the project source-code repository, with frequent application
  of patches from Tim Waugh <twaugh@users.sourceforge.net>.

September 2002 - March 2003: "The Joe Orton Era"
  The man-pages stylesheets are moved to [cvs]/docbook/xsl/manpages
  and become a standard part of all subsequent DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets releases. Joe Orton <jorton@users.sourceforge.net>
  takes over manpages maintenance; more patches from Tim Waugh.

March 2003 - May 2005: "Tim Waugh At the Helm"
  Tim Waugh, eventually realizing that the possibility exists to
  commit changes to to a source-code repository *directly*, joins
  the project and takes over manpages maintenance, making a lot of
  fixes and refinements.

May 2005 - present: "Journey Into Mystery"
  A sense of apprehension and uncertainty sets in as the
  least-skilled and most frequently inebriated member of the
  project takes over manpages maintenance.

README for db2man by Martijn van Beers (lotr@users.sourceforge.net)

I've been working on some stylesheets to convert <refentry>s to man
format. I thought I'd submit what I have for inclusion in the
docbook-xsl package.
