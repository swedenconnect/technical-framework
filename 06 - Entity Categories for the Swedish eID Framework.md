## 1. Introduction

This specification contains the Entity Category definitions that are
defined for the Swedish eID Framework and that should be supported by
Service Providers and Identity Providers that are part of the
federation.

The use of Entity Categories for the Swedish eID Framework is restricted
to SAML metadata where Entity Categories are placed as SAML attributes
under the `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` element
(\[[SAML2MetaAttr](#saml2metaattr)\]) for an `<md:Extensions>` element
(\[[SAML2Meta](#saml2meta)\]).

    <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://eid2.example.com/entityid">
      <md:Extensions>
        <mdattr:EntityAttributes xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
        ... 
          <saml:Attribute Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category"
                                   NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri">
            <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xsi:type="xs:string">
              http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr
            </saml:AttributeValue>    
          </saml:Attribute>    
        </mdattr:EntityAttributes>    
      </md:Extensions>    
      ...

*The Entity Category identifier
__`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr`__ specified as an entity
attribute for a Service Provider or Identity Provider.*

Five types of Entity Categories are used within the federation:

-   Service entity category – Identifiers for entity categories
    representing sets of requirements.

-   Service property categories – Identifiers for defined service
    properties.

-   Service type categories – Identifiers for defined service types.

-   Service contract categories - Identifiers for labelling entities based on contracts or business agreements.

-	General categories - Identifiers defined within the Swedish eID Framework for miscellaneous purposes.

<a name="requirements-notation"></a>
### 1.1. Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in \[[RFC2119](#rfc2119)\].

The use of SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and RECOMMENDED reflects broad consensus
on deployment practices intended to foster both interoperability and
guarantees of security and confidentiality needed to satisfy the
requirements of many organizations that engage in the use of federated
identity. Deviating may limit a deployment's ability to technically
interoperate without additional negotiation, and should be undertaken
with caution.

<a name="references-to-saml-20-standards-and-profiles"></a>
### 1.2. References to SAML 2.0 Standards and Profiles

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 core specification
\[[SAML2Core](#saml2core)\], the following syntax is used:

-   `<saml2p:Element>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0 Protocol
    namespace.

-   `<saml2:Element>` – for elements from the SAML 2.0 Assertion
    namespace.

When referring to elements from the SAML 2.0 metadata specifications,
the following syntax is used:

-   `<md:Element>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2Meta](#saml2meta)\].

-   `<mdattr:Element>` – for elements defined in \[[SAML2MetaAttr](#saml2metaattr)\].

<a name="consuming-and-providing-services"></a>
### 1.3. Consuming and Providing Services

Entity categories are mainly used for service matching. This allows
matching of a consuming service with an appropriate providing service. A
consuming service in this context is an assertion or attribute consuming
service of a service provider (Service described through an
`<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element in the federation metadata). A
providing service in this context is a service, represented in the
federation metadata, providing assertions to a service provider.

The entity categories defined in this document have different meaning
depending on whether they are declared by a consuming or a providing
service. Further, different types of entity category identifiers defined
in this document have different matching rules to determine whether
particular providing service matches the requirements of a consuming
service.

These differences are outlined in the following table:

| EC type | Consuming service | Providing service | Service matching rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Service Entity Category** | Each declared category represents a set of requirements for the service. | Represents the ability to deliver assertions in accordance with each declared category. | At least one of the service entity categories declared by the consuming service MUST be declared by the providing service. |
| **Service Property** | Represents a property of this service. | Represents the ability to deliver assertions to a consuming service that has the declared property. | All properties declared by the consuming service MUST be declared by the providing service. |
| **Service Type** | Declares the type of service provided by this consuming service. | Not applicable. | No matching rule. |
| **Service Contract** | Each declared category represents a contract, or business agreement, that the service is affiliated to. | Represents the contracts, or business agreements, under which the providing service may deliver services. | At least one of the service contract identifiers declared by a providing service must be declared by the consuming service. A providing service that does not declare any service contract identifiers match all consuming services regarding service contract matching. |
| **General** | An entity category type for miscellaneous purposes. | An entity category type for miscellaneous purposes. | No general matching rule.<br />However, the meaning of a general entity category may be such that it affects matching. |

<a name="use-in-discovery"></a>
### 1.4. Use in Discovery

Entity Categories in metadata are declarations of requirements and
capabilities of Service Providers and Identity Providers. A discovery
process may make use of these declared Entity Categories when performing
filtering, i.e., when deciding which Identity Providers to present for
the end-user. The filtering algorithm is very simple:

For a Service Provider requesting discovery its metadata entry is
scanned for Entity Category identifiers of the type Service Entity
Category, Service Contract and Service Property. The algorithm then iterates over all
Identity Providers found in the metadata repository for the
federation. The discovery process SHOULD display Identity Providers as
a plausible choice, if and only if, the following conditions apply;

-   the Identity Provider declares at least of the Service Entity Category 
    identifiers declared by the Service Provider,

-   if the Identity Provider declares at least one Service Contract identifier,
    the Service Provider must declare at least one of declared identifiers, and,

-   all of the Service Property identifiers declared by the Service
    Provider must be declared by the Identity Provider.

<a name="representation-of-entity-categories-in-metadata"></a>
### 1.5. Representation of Entity Categories in Metadata

Entity categories defined in this document are placed in an entity’s
metadata record as an attribute value within an entity category
attribute (SAML attribute with name `http://macedir.org/entity-category`).
If more than one entity category identifier is included in the metadata
of a service, it MUST be placed as multiple attribute values within a
single entity category attribute.

*Example of how entity categories are represented in metadata.*

<a name="definitions-for-service-entity-categories"></a>
## 2. Definitions for Service Entity Categories

This section contains a listing of all Service Entity Categories that
are defined within the framework for Swedish eID.

All service entity category identifiers are prefixed with
`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec` or `http://id.swedenconnect.se/ec` (defined after Aug. 2018).

A service entity category identifies an arbitrary set of requirements and conditions that is required by the consuming service and provided by the providing service. Each service entity category specifies its own set of requirements and conditions. Typically such requirements and conditions include requirements on level of assurance (LoA) and requirements on mandatory attributes. For contract- or business agreement requirements [Service Contract Categories](#service-contract-categories) should be used.

A providing service declaring a service entity category that consists of both a level of assurance requirement and an attribute set MUST guarantee that the release of the given attributes are consistent with the level of assurance requirement.

This specification does not impose any other limitations on what requirements or conditions that can be identified by a service entity category and there are no defined technical mechanisms to ensure that any service correctly implement any of these requirements. The main purpose of the service entity category is service matching in accordance with [section 1.3](#consuming-and-providing-services) and any requirements and conditions that serves this purpose are considered valid.

**Note**: A providing service that does not comply with any of the defined service entity categories may define its own service entity category identifier in order to utilize the entity category matching rules. Any service entity category identifier defined outside of this specification should use the prefix `http://id.swedenconnect.se/ec/<org>`, where `org` is the defining organization's identifier.

<a name="loa3-pnr"></a>
### 2.1. loa3-pnr

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa3-pnr`

**Description**: User authentication according to assurance level 3 \[[EidTillit](#eidtillit)\] and attribute release according to the attribute set “Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number (personnummer)” (ELN-AP-Pnr-01).

**LoA-identifier**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa3`

**Attribute requirements**: ELN-AP-Pnr-01 (`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/pnr-01`)
> Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number (personnummer).
> 
> **Note**: The `http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/pnr-01` attribute set includes the `personalIdentityNumber` attribute, which is defined to hold either a Swedish identity personal number (”personnummer”) defined in \[[SKV 704](#skv704)\], or a Swedish coordination number (”samordningsnummer”) as defined in \[[SKV 707](#skv707)\]. 
> 
> However, since a Swedish coordination number (”samordningsnummer”) is not consistent with assurance level 3, the `personalIdentityNumber` attribute is only allowed to hold a Swedish personal identity number ("personnummer") if the scope of the `loa3-pnr` service entity category.

<a name="loa2-pnr"></a>
### 2.2. loa2-pnr

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/loa2-pnr`

**Description**: User authentication according to assurance level 2 \[[EidTillit](#eidtillit)\] and attribute release according to the attribute set “Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number (personnummer)” (ELN-AP-Pnr-01).

**LoA-identifier**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/loa/1.0/loa2`

**Attribute requirements**: ELN-AP-Pnr-01 (`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/pnr-01`)

**Attribute requirements**: ELN-AP-Pnr-01 (`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/pnr-01`)
> Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number (personnummer)
>
> **Note**: See the restriction described in section [2.1](#loa3-pnr), [loa3-pnr](#loa3-pnr).


<a name="eidas-naturalperson"></a>
### 2.4. eidas-naturalperson

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/eidas-naturalperson`

**Description**: User authentication according to any of the eIDAS assurance levels and attribute release according to “eIDAS Natural Person Attribute Set” (ELN-AP-eIDAS-NatPer-01).

**LoA-identifier**:   Not applicable
> It does not make sense to specify the level of assurance for a Service
> Entity Categories intended for eIDAS since this information is not known
> to the Swedish eIDAS-node.

**Attribute requirements**: ELN-AP-eIDAS-NatPer-01 (`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/eidas-natural-person-01`)
> eIDAS Natural Person Attribute Set

<a name="eidas-pnr-delivery"></a>
### 2.5. eidas-pnr-delivery

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/ec/1.0/eidas-pnr-delivery`

**Description**: For asserting a Swedish identity to a foreign service provider via the Swedish eIDAS Proxy Service. This entity category MUST NOT be set by any entity other than Identity Provider providing identity assertions to the Swedish eIDAS Proxy Service and by the Swedish eIDAS Proxy Service itself.

Attribute release is based on the "Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number" attribute set with the addition of a mandatory `dateOfBirth`-attribute (`urn:oid:1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.1`). The reason for the mandatory `dateOfBirth`-attribute is that this information is required by the eIDAS minimum dataset and therefore must be obtained by the receiving eIDAS Proxy Service. Date of birth can not always reliably be derived from the `personalIdentityNumber` attribute.

It is the responsibility of the Swedish eIDAS Proxy Service to transform these attributes into eIDAS attributes.

**LoA-identifier**: Not applicable
> An Identity Provider delivering assertions to the eIDAS framework is obliged to announce which levels that it supports by including the corresponding eIDAS authentication context URIs defined in section 3.1.1 of \[[EidRegistry](#eidregistry)\] as assurance certification attributes in its metadata as described in section 2.1.3 of \[[EidDeploy](#eiddeploy)\].

**Attribute requirements**: 

- ELN-AP-Pnr-01 (`http://id.elegnamnden.se/ap/1.0/pnr-01`) 

> Natural Personal Identity with Civic Registration Number (personnummer)

* `dateOfBirth`-attribute (`urn:oid:1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.1`).

<a name="definitions-for-service-property-categories"></a>
## 3. Definitions for Service Property Categories

A Service Property Entity Category identifier is specified as an
attribute value in the entity category attribute in the federation
metadata and has the purpose of representing a particular service
property.

All Service Type identifiers are prefixed with
**`http://id.elegnamnden.se/sprop`**.

<a name="mobile-auth"></a>
### 3.1. mobile-auth

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/sprop/1.0/mobile-auth`

**Description**: A service property declaring that the service is adapted to mobile clients and MUST allow users to authenticate using a mobile device that is used to access such service.

For a providing service, i.e. an Identity Provider, inclusion of the
mobile-auth category states that the Identity Provider supports
authentication using mobile devices, **and** that the end-user interface
of the Identity Provider is adapted for mobile clients.

Note that an Identity Provider may of course support authentication for
both desktop and mobile users. In these cases the service must be able
to display end user interfaces for both types of clients.

A discovery process will use this Service Property when performing
filtering of possible Identity Providers, as described in [1.4](#use-in-discovery-services), “[Use in
Discovery](#use-in-discovery-services)”. This means that a consuming service may include the
mobile-auth category in its metadata in order to have the discovery
process especially displaying Identity Providers that offer
authentication using mobile devices.

<a name="scal2"></a>
### 3.2. scal2

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/sprop/1.0/scal2`

**Description**: A service property declaring that the service is adapted to support Sole Control Assurance Level 2 (SCAL2) in accordance with \[[SigSAP](#sigsap)\]. 

For a providing service, i.e. an Identity Provider, inclusion of the
scal2 service property states that the Identity Provider will return a "SAD" in response to a `SADRequest` in an authentication requests from a signing service.

For consuming services, Signature Services MAY include this service property if all authentication requests from the 
particular Signature Service include a `SADRequest` extension. A Service Provider that is not declared as a Signature Service MUST NOT include this service property in its metadata.

<a name="definitions-for-service-type-entity-categories"></a>
## 4. Definitions for Service Type Entity Categories

A Service Type Entity Category identifier is specified as an entity
attribute in the federation metadata and has the purpose of representing
a particular service type.

All Service Type identifiers are prefixed with
**`http://id.elegnamnden.se/st`**.


<a name="sigservice"></a>
### 4.1. sigservice

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/sigservice`

**Description**:  A service type for a Service Provider that provides electronic signature services within the Swedish eID framework.

<a name="public-sector-sp"></a>
### 4.2. public-sector-sp

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/public-sector-sp`

**Description**: A service type that indicates that a Service Provider is a "public sector" SP. This category MUST be used by public sector Service Providers wishing to use eIDAS authentication so that the Swedish eIDAS connector may include this information in the eIDAS authentication request.

<a name="private-sector-sp"></a>
### 4.3. private-sector-sp

**URL**: `http://id.elegnamnden.se/st/1.0/private-sector-sp`

**Description**: A service type that indicates that a Service Provider is a "private sector" SP. This category MUST be used by private sector Service Providers wishing to use eIDAS authentication so that the Swedish eIDAS connector may include this information in the eIDAS authentication request.

<a name="service-contract-categories"></a>
## 5. Service Contract Categories

Service Contract Entity Category identifiers are indented for performing service matching based on contracts, or business agreements, between providing and consuming services.

All Service Contract identifiers are prefixed with `http://id.swedenconnect.se/contract/<org>`, where `org` is identifier for the defining organization.

The meaning of different contracts and business agreements are out of scope for this specification. Instead the federation operator, or other parties, may define identifiers suitable for representing how consuming and providing services should be matched based on their respective agreements.


<a name="general-entity-categories"></a>
## 6. General Entity Categories

An entity category of the General Entity Category type is a category that does not fit into any of the other category types regarding definitions and matching rules.

General category identifiers are prefixed with `http://id.swedenconnect.se/general-ec`.

<a name="secure-authenticator-binding"></a>
### 6.1. secure-authenticator-binding

**URL**: `http://id.swedenconnect.se/general-ec/1.0/secure-authenticator-binding`

**Description**: Some authentication schemes use an authentication device (*authenticator*) that 
is external, i.e., not bound to the user agent. These types of authentication schemes may be
vulnerable to certain types of phishing attacks where a fraudster who controls the user agent can
trick, or persuade, the user to initiate an operation on the authentication device. 

A typical example of the threat described above is where an Identity Provider implements an
authentication scheme that uses a mobile app as the authenticator. In those cases the user
normally enters some input (often the user identity) in the web browser (user agent) that is
then used by the Identity Provider to initiate an authentication session against the app running
on the user's mobile device. The problem here is that there is no way we can now that the
person initiating the operation in the web browser by entering a user identity is the same 
person who opens, and performs the authentication in the app. 

In order to prevent attacks of this type many authentication schemes offer alternative ways
of initiating authentication (or signature) sessions, where some sort of binding between the
user agent and the authentication device is performed. An good example of this is when 
Identity Providers prompt the user to scan a QR-code displayed in the web browser using the 
authentication app instead of prompting for the user identity. This effectively binds the
user agent to the same physical location as the authentication device, and in practice
makes the attacks described above impossible.

This profile defines the `http://id.swedenconnect.se/general-ec/1.0/secure-authenticator-binding` 
entity category to be declared by Service Providers that require that a secure authenticator
binding is performed by the Identity Providers supporting this.

An Identity Provider that supports different methods of initiating authentication, or signature,
operations, and where at least one of these methods is a "secure authenticator binding" SHOULD
declare the `http://id.swedenconnect.se/general-ec/1.0/secure-authenticator-binding` entity
category in its metadata.

An Identity Provider that has declared the `http://id.swedenconnect.se/general-ec/1.0/secure-authenticator-binding` category in its metadata MUST perform a secure authenticator binding for requests sent
from Service Providers that have declared this entity category in their metadata entries.
