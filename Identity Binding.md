## 1. Introduction

Public relying parties in Sweden commonly use the Swedish personal 
identification number (a.k.a. personnummer) or the Swedish coordination 
number (a.k.a. samordningsnummer) as identifier to carry out the 
authorisation of the authenticated user. These records cannot be found
in eIDAS attributes. 

The Identity Binding Service is an extension to Swedish eIDAS-node and 
a part of Sweden's digital infrastructure aimed at linking records in 
the Swedish population register to notified eIDs from member states 
outside of Sweden.

<a name="the-identity-binding-service"></a>
## 2. The Identity Binding Service
The Identity Binding Service can be used by end-users, who are 
authenticated through eIDAS, in those cases when:
- end-user have a registered record in terms of Swedish personal identification number (a.k.a. personnummer) or the Swedish coordination number (a.k.a. samordningsnummer) in the Swedish population register, and
- end-user have chosen to bound this record to her/his eIDAS notified eID.

When end-user's Swedish records are linked to her/his eID, the Swedish eIDAS-node can 
provide this information in the assertion to relying party.

<a name="making-a-binding"></a>
### 2.1. Making a Binding
Identity binding can be made through a number of different [Record Matching Processes](#record-matching-processes). 
These processes are run separately or in combinations and can result in linked 
identifications based on three different levels of confidence. See also 
[section 3, "Identity Binding Levels"](#identity-binding-levels)

> TODO: Include links to https://elegitimation.se and other resources where we describe
the ID-matching service.
    
<a name="eidas-node-queries"></a>
### 2.2. eIDAS-node Queries

The identity bindings of the Identity Binding service will be accessible for the
Swedish eIDAS-node via a query-API. During an eIDAS authentication the Swedish eIDAS-node
will query this API for a binding between the attributes presented in the assertion 
received from the foreign node and a Swedish personal identity number. If such a
binding exists two attributes will be added to the resulting assertion delivered to
the Swedish relying party (service provider). These attributes are:

- `urn:oid:1.2.752.201.3.16` (mappedPersonalIdentityNumber) - Contains the Swedish
personal identity number that was bound to the eIDAS identity.

- `urn:oid:1.2.752.201.3.6` (personalIdentityNumberBinding) - Contains an URI that
represents the [Identity Binding Level](#identity-binding-levels).

See also sections 2.5, "eIDAS Natural Person Attribute Set", and 3.3.2, "The mappedPersonalIdentityNumber and personalIdentityNumberBinding Attributes", of [Attribute Specification for the Swedish eID Framework](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/technical-framework/updates/04_-_Attribute_Specification_for_the_Swedish_eID_Framework.html) for more information
about attribute release during an eIDAS authentication.

<a name="identity-binding-levels"></a>
## 3. Identity Binding Levels
Linked identifications through the Identity Binding Service can be provided in three different levels of confidence. 
These levels can be used in the authorisation process by the relying party. 

<a name="basic-binding"></a>
### 3.1. Basic Binding (A)

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/basic`

**Description:** Level of confidence in binding as a result from an automated decision process when the eIDAS attributes from the foreign eID are matched to an individual's record in the Swedish population register.

Following processes must have been applied:
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered` ([4.1](#essential-matching-population-register))
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister` ([4.2](#elevated-matching-population-register))
    
<a name="enhanced-binding"></a>
### 3.2. Enhanced Binding (B)

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/enhanced`

**Description:** In addition to meeting all the requirements for basic level, 
the binding can be endorsed with a higher confidence when the process 
`http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid` ([4.3](#nordic-id-in-population-register)) 
can match attribute in the assertion from eIDAS to a registered Nordic identification number in the Swedish population register.

In summary, following processes must have been applied:
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered` ([4.1](#essential-matching-population-register))
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister` ([4.2](#elevated-matching-population-register))
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid` ([4.3](#nordic-id-in-population-register))
    
<a name="verified-binding"></a>
### 3.3. Verified Binding (C)

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/verified`

**Description:** A mix of processes must be applied in order to achieve the 
highest level of confidence in record matching. It requires the process `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered` ([4.1](#essential-matching-population-register)) combined with one of the following processes:
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/swedish-eid` ([4.4](#use-of-swedish-eid))
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/relative` ([4.5](#confirmed-by-relative))
- `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/iddoc-scanning` ([4.6](#passport-or-id-card-scanning))

## 4. Record Matching Processes

This section contains a detailed description of the record matching processes that
are used by the Identity Binding Service. Each process is identified with an URI.

> Note: The process URI:s are not part of a resulting SAML assertion. However, they will
be stored in matching records and log entries.

<a name="essential-matching-population-register"></a>
### 4.1. Essential matching of record in the population register

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered`

**Description:** A record based on the identification number provided by the end-user 
is found in the Swedish pouplation register. It belongs to a living natural person and 
the value for birthday in record is matched to the birthday attribute from eIDAS. 

<a name="elevated-matching-population-register"></a>
### 4.2. Elevated  matching of record in the population register

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister`

**Description:** Name attributes from eIDAS is matched to record in population register. 
Population register show that person has emigrated and doesn't live in Sweden. A wide 
search in population register show that there are no other records found with the 
same birthday and name, thus decision for record matching can be made unambiguously.

<a name="nordic-id-in-population-register"></a>
### 4.3. Nordic identification number found in the population register

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid`

**Description:** Record in population register contains an identification number from 
other Nordic country and this number can be found in the assetion from eIDAS. 

<a name="use-of-swedish-eid"></a>
### 4.4. Use of Swedish eID

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/swedish-eid`

**Description:** The end-user, who has been authenticated with a foreign eID, can 
prove binding to the Swedish identification number by signing a confirmation with 
her/his Swedish eID.

**Additional requirements:** Assurance for the Swedish eID must be minimum at 
level 3 in accordance of the Swedish Trust Framework (a.k.a. Tillitsramverk f√∂r 
Svensk e-legitimation). Using eID for this purpose must also be approved by the 
eID provider.
    
<a name="confirmed-by-relative"></a>
### 4.5. A relative has confirmed the binding

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/relative`

**Description:** A relative to the end-user, can log in with her/his Swedish eID 
and verify binding by signing a confirmation. Relationship must be official and 
findable in the Swedish population register. Example of relationship is husband, 
wife, parent and child. 

**Additional requirements:** Relative must be at least 18 years old and have a 
Swedish eID that meet same requirements as in section [4.2](#use-of-swedish-eid) above.

<a name="passport-or-id-card-scanning"></a>
### 4.5. Passport or ID-card scanning

**URI:** `http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/iddoc-scanning`

**Description:** The end-user, who has been authenticated with a foreign eID, can 
prove binding to the Swedish identification number by reading chip from a Swedish 
identity document, such as passport or ID-card.
