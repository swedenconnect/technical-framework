<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Public relying parties in Sweden commonly use the Swedish personal 
identity number (a.k.a. personnummer) or the Swedish coordination 
number (a.k.a. samordningsnummer) as the primary identifier to carry 
out the authorization of an authenticated user. These attributes are 
not part of an eIDAS assertion received from an another country even
if the authenticated user holds a Swedish identity number.  </p>
<p>Using an Identity Binding Service, end users can associate 
their eIDAS eID with their record in the Swedish population 
register. And, in such manner, end users can gain access to more 
Swedish digital services.</p>
<p><a name="the-identity-binding-service"></a></p>
<h2 id="2-the-identity-binding-service">2. The Identity Binding Service</h2>
<p>The Identity Binding Service is a part of the Swedish eIDAS infrastructure.
For users that hold an eIDAS notified eID, it provides support in binding processes,
which give end users the ability to associate their eID to a record in the Swedish
population register. </p>
<p>When records have been matched, this identity binding can be utilized 
by the Swedish eIDAS-node when the end user attempts to log in to a Swedish digital 
service using his or hers foreign eID. The assertion that is provided to relying party 
includes attributes from eIDAS as well as attributes from the Identity Binding Service.</p>
<p>The Identity Binding Service can be used by end users, who are authenticated through 
eIDAS, in the cases when:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the end user has a registered record in terms of Swedish personal identity number 
(a.k.a. personnummer) or Swedish coordination number (a.k.a. samordningsnummer) in the
Swedish population register, and</li>
<li>the end user has chosen to associate this record to his or her eIDAS notified eID.</li>
</ul>
<p>When ab end user&#39;s Swedish record are linked to his or her eID, the Swedish eIDAS-node can 
provide this information in the assertion to relying party.</p>
<p><a name="making-a-binding"></a></p>
<h3 id="21-making-a-binding">2.1. Making a Binding</h3>
<p>Identity binding can be made through a number of different 
<a href="#identity-binding-processes">Identity Binding Processes</a>. These processes are run separately
or in combination and can result in an identity binding based on three different levels
of confidence. See also <a href="#identity-binding-levels">section 3, &quot;Identity Binding Levels&quot;</a></p>
<p><a name="eidas-node-queries"></a></p>
<h3 id="22-eidas-node-queries">2.2. eIDAS-node Queries</h3>
<p>The identity bindings of the Identity Binding service will be accessible for the
Swedish eIDAS-node via a query-API. During an eIDAS authentication, the Swedish eIDAS-node
will query this API for a binding between the attributes presented in the assertion 
received from the foreign node and a Swedish personal identity number. If such a
binding exists two attributes will be added to the resulting assertion delivered to
the Swedish relying party (service provider). These attributes are:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><code>urn:oid:1.2.752.201.3.16</code> (mappedPersonalIdentityNumber) - Contains the Swedish
personal identity number that was bound to the eIDAS identity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>urn:oid:1.2.752.201.3.6</code> (personalIdentityNumberBinding) - Contains an URI that
represents the <a href="#identity-binding-levels">Identity Binding Level</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See also sections 2.5, &quot;eIDAS Natural Person Attribute Set&quot;, and 3.3.2, &quot;The mappedPersonalIdentityNumber and personalIdentityNumberBinding Attributes&quot;, of <a href="https://docs.swedenconnect.se/technical-framework/updates/04_-_Attribute_Specification_for_the_Swedish_eID_Framework.html">Attribute Specification for the Swedish eID Framework</a> for more information
about attribute release during an eIDAS authentication.</p>
<p><a name="identity-binding-levels"></a></p>
<h2 id="3-identity-binding-levels">3. Identity Binding Levels</h2>
<p>Identity Bindings are provided in three different levels of confidence. 
These levels can be used in the authorization process by the relying party. </p>
<p><a name="basic-binding"></a></p>
<h3 id="31-basic-binding-a">3.1. Basic Binding (A)</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/basic</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Basic level of confidence in binding as a result from an automated decision process when the eIDAS attributes from the foreign eID are matched to an individual&#39;s record in the Swedish population register.</p>
<p>The following processes must have been applied:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered</code> (<a href="#essential-matching-population-register">4.1</a>)</li>
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister</code> (<a href="#elevated-matching-population-register">4.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="enhanced-binding"></a></p>
<h3 id="32-enhanced-binding-b">3.2. Enhanced Binding (B)</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/enhanced</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In addition to meeting all the requirements for the basic level, 
the binding can be endorsed with a higher confidence when the process 
<code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid</code> (<a href="#nordic-id-in-population-register">4.3</a>) 
can match attribute in the assertion from eIDAS to a registered Nordic identification number in the Swedish population register.</p>
<p>In summary, following processes must have been applied:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered</code> (<a href="#essential-matching-population-register">4.1</a>)</li>
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister</code> (<a href="#elevated-matching-population-register">4.2</a>)</li>
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid</code> (<a href="#nordic-id-in-population-register">4.3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="verified-binding"></a></p>
<h3 id="33-verified-binding-c">3.3. Verified Binding (C)</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/level/verified</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A mix of processes must be applied in order to achieve the highest level of 
confidence in record matching. It requires the process <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered</code> (<a href="#essential-matching-population-register">4.1</a>) combined with one of the following processes:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/swedish-eid</code> (<a href="#use-of-swedish-eid">4.4</a>)</li>
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/relative</code> (<a href="#confirmed-by-relative">4.5</a>)</li>
<li><code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/iddoc-scanning</code> (<a href="#passport-or-id-card-scanning">4.6</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="identity-binding-processes"></a></p>
<h2 id="4-identity-binding-processes">4. Identity Binding Processes</h2>
<p>This section contains a detailed description of the matching processes that
are used by the Identity Binding Service. Each process is identified with an URI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The process URI:s are not part of a resulting SAML assertion. However, they will
be stored in matching records and log entries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="essential-matching-population-register"></a></p>
<h3 id="41-essential-matching-of-record-in-the-population-register">4.1. Essential Matching of Record in the Population Register</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/registered</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A binding process based on the fact that a Swedish identity number that has
been provided by the end user is found in the Swedish population register. This record must
belong to a living natural person, and its value for birth date must match the birth date 
attribute from the eIDAS assertion. </p>
<p><a name="elevated-matching-population-register"></a></p>
<h3 id="42-elevated-matching-of-record-in-the-population-register">4.2. Elevated Matching of Record in the Population Register</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/populationregister</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Name attributes from an eIDAS assertion are matched against a record in
the population register. A wide search in the population register shows that there are no
other records found with the same birth date and name, thus, a decision for record matching
can be made unambiguously.</p>
<p><a name="nordic-id-in-population-register"></a></p>
<h3 id="43-nordic-identification-number-found-in-the-population-register">4.3. Nordic Identification Number Found in the Population Register</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/nordicid</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A record in the population register contains an identity number from 
an Nordic country and this number can be found in the eIDAS assertion.</p>
<p><a name="use-of-swedish-eid"></a></p>
<h3 id="44-use-of-swedish-eid">4.4. Use of Swedish eID</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/swedish-eid</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The end user, who has been authenticated with a foreign eID, can 
prove a binding to the Swedish identity number by signing a confirmation with 
his or her Swedish eID.</p>
<p><strong>Additional requirements:</strong> Assurance for the Swedish eID must be minimum at 
level 3 in accordance of the 
<a href="https://www.digg.se/digitala-tjanster/e-legitimering/tillitsnivaer-for-e-legitimering/tillitsramverk-for-svensk-e-legitimation">Swedish Trust Framework</a>

Svensk e-legitimation</a>). 
Using the eID for this purpose must also be approved by the eID provider.</p>
<p><a name="confirmed-by-relative"></a></p>
<h3 id="45-a-relative-to-end-user-has-confirmed-the-binding">4.5. A Relative to End User has Confirmed the Binding</h3>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <code>http://id.swedenconnect.se/id-binding/process/relative</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A relative of the end user, logs in with his or her Swedish eID 
and verifies the binding by signing a confirmation. The relationship must be official and 
stored in the Swedish population register. Examples of valid relationships are spouses, parents
