## 1. Introduction

This document contains updates to the current version of the Swedish eID Framework. The current version of the Swedish eID Framework is published on [www.elegnamnden.se](http://www.elegnamnden.se), and comprises of specifications that are listed as “normative references” in chapter [1.1.1](#Swedish-eID-Framework).

The updates presented in this document will be suggested to be part of the next official version of the Swedish eID Framework, and parties are
not required to implement, or support, a suggested update until it is part of a Swedish eID Framework specification. However, Identity Providers are strongly advised to implement the updates in this document that concerns interoperability issues and/or covers a specific functionality that is handled by the Identity Provider<sup>1</sup>.

For each update the following is covered:

-   The reason for the update.

-   The parties that will be affected by the change.

The update document represents changes that are not “substantive”. The changes focus on clarifications to ambiguous or conflicting
specification text, and are intended to reduce interoperability problems within the Swedish eID federation.

In this document, update change instructions are presented with surrounding context as necessary to make the intent clear. Original
specification text is often presented as follows, with problem text highlighted in bold:  

* "This is an original specification. **This is text that needs to be changed.**"

New specification text is typically presented as follows, with new or
changed text highlighted in bold:

* "This is an original specification. **This is the new text that was added in the errata.**"


> \[1\]: E-legitimationsnämnden may also enforce that a specific Identity Provider implements a given update before it is included in an official release of the Swedish eID Framework. Typically, that may be the case when important functions within the federation do not function as intended without the proper support of the Identity Provider.

### E.1. Requirement for AssertionConsumerServiceURL in Authentication Requests

**Updates**: Version 1.3 of the “Deployment Profile for the Swedish eID Framework”

Section 5.3 of \[EidProfile\] states that a `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>`
message MUST contain an `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute
identifying the desired response location. It has shown that this
requirement aggravates interoperability since some of the major
providers of Service Provider software do not fully support this
attribute. Furthermore, the requirement does increase security since an
Identity Provider may only post response messages to locations
registered in the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements of the
Service Provider metadata entry. Therefore, the following changes are
made:

In section 5.3 of \[EidProfile\]:

Original:

> **\[SAML2Int\]** specifies that a `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message
> **MUST** contain an `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying
> the desired response location.

New:

> The `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message **SHOULD** contain an
> `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute identifying the desired response
> location.

In section 5.4.2 of \[EidProfile\]:

Original:

> **The value of the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute of the
> `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message** MUST be verified to be
> consistent with one of the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>`
> elements having the HTTP-POST binding found in the Service Provider’s
> metadata entry. If this is not the case, the request must be rejected.

New:

> **If the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute is present in the
>  `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, its value** MUST be verified to
> be consistent with one of the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>`
> elements having the HTTP-POST binding found in the Service Provider’s
> metadata entry. If this is not the case, the request must be rejected.
>
> **If the attribute is not present in the `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` message, the Identity Provider MUST obtain the desired response location from the Service Provider’s metadata entry. This location is found in an `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` element with HTTP-POST binding that is marked as default (has the `isDefault` attribute set), or if no element has the `isDefault` attribute set, the one with the lowest index value (see section 2.4.4.1 of \[SAML2Meta\]).**

In section 6.3.2 of \[EidProfile\]:

New:

> The `Recipient` attribute from the bearer `<saml2:SubjectConfirmationData>` element MUST match the location to which the `<saml2p:Response>` message was delivered and match value the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute included in the request message, **or if this attribute was not provided in the request message, the default response location specified in the Service Provider’s metadata entry, as described in section 5.4.2.**
